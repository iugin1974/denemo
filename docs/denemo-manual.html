<h1 class="part" id='magicparlabel-10'><span class="part_label">Part I</span> Getting Started</h1>
<h2 class="section_" id='magicparlabel-11'>Introduction  <a id='magicparlabel-15' />
</h2>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-16'>Denemo lets you create musical scores. You can type music in using the keyboard or play it in using a MIDI contoller or the microphone input. You can edit your music – the input display window shows you what you are working on in music notation – and you can playback to check how it sounds. The Print View window shows the final printed score, typeset to the highest standards used in the music publishing industry – thanks to the Lilypond music typesetting program.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-17'>This separation of the final typesetting window from the input display avoids the constant dragging about of overlapping notation which is typical of music notation programs. It also means you are less likely to input a slur when you mean a tie, or a whole note rest when you mean a whole measure rest, for example – these often look similar in the typeset and are easily confused, but Denemo's input display makes clear the distinction. Nevertheless, if you do wish to tweak the appearance dragging and re-positioning of some notation is possible on the final typeset display.</div>
<h4 class="subsubsection_" id='magicparlabel-18'>Some Terminology</h4>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-19'>Besides the terms well-known to musicians, music notation has some specialized names and Denemo uses some terms with specific meanings which you should know:</div>

<ul class="itemize" id='magicparlabel-20'><li class="itemize_item">A<em> movement<a id='magicparlabel-24' />
</em> is a continous stretch of music (all the measures following on from each other) such as a song in a songbook, or a movement in a symphony.</li>
<li class="itemize_item">A <em>score<a id='magicparlabel-29' />
</em> is one or more movements usually interspersed with titles.</li>
<li class="itemize_item">A <em>staff<a id='magicparlabel-34' />
</em> has the usual meaning, but note that it may contain several lines of music (voices). A Denemo staff may also be typeset as a line of Chord Symbols<a id='magicparlabel-38' />
, Fret Diagrams<a id='magicparlabel-42' />
, or a line of dynamics markings above or below some other staff.</li>
<li class="itemize_item">The term <em>voice<a id='magicparlabel-47' />
</em> is used in two senses: as a line of music moving independently on a staff, <dfn class='lyxnoun'>and</dfn> (as in <em>Voice 1</em>, <em>Voice 2</em>), a voice that has its stems in one direction, with corresponding changes to the placing of ties, slurs, ornaments etc). Voices are normally displayed on separate staffs in the Denemo Display to make them easy to edit; the LilyPond typesetter has the task of placing them on the same staff.</li>
<li class="itemize_item">A <em>chord</em><a id='magicparlabel-52' />
 is one or more notes of the same duration making a single musical object. If the notes are of different durations then they have to be placed in separate voices, they can't be a chord, though they may appear so (by sharing stems) in the typeset.</li>
<li class="itemize_item">A <em>system<a id='magicparlabel-57' />
 </em>is what might be called a &ldquo;line&rdquo; of the music on the page, that is all the music (over several staffs) that sounds together starting at the left-hand margin and ending at the right margin.</li>
<li class="itemize_item"><em><a id='magicparlabel-62' />
Markup</em> is text – e.&thinsp;g. titles – that can have additional characters to indicate bold or italic, repositioning etc. In Denemo this may even include syntax for snippets of music, note-names fret diagrams etc., so that these can appear in the text.</li>
<li class="itemize_item"><em>Staff Spaces</em> a unit of measurement: the distance between adjacent lines in a staff. Generally when you need to specify a distance in Denemo this is the unit used. So the Markup to System spacing is the spacing between the last title and the first staff.</li>
<li class="itemize_item"><em>Part </em>is used with a special sense in Denemo: each staff has a part name associated with it (printed at top left of the staff, with a green background for editing it). All staffs with the same part name (or with none) are typeset together by the Print Part<a id='magicparlabel-68' />
 command.</li>
<li class="itemize_item"><a href="http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.18/Documentation/music-glossary/index.html">http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.18/Documentation/music-glossary/index.html</a>is a good guide especially for non-native speakers of English.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="section" id='magicparlabel-70'><span class="section_label">1</span> Input Methods</h2>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-71'>Most people will start with playing around with Denemo using the mouse, but by the time you are reading this you will want something more efficient. Try using the pc keyboard. By default, keys <span style='font-family:monospace;'>a</span> to <span style='font-family:monospace;'>g</span> represent the note names and <span style='font-family:monospace;'>0</span> to<span style='font-family:monospace;'> 6</span> the different durations (whole note, half note etc). When the cursor is appending (blue) pressing key <span style='font-family:monospace;'>0</span> will insert a whole note at the cursor. Pressing the <span style='font-family:monospace;'>a</span> key will append the nearest A. If the duration of the next note is the same you can simply type the note name, it will use the last entered duration. There are keypresses (+/-, and plus/minus on the numeric keypad) to set sharp/flat/double-sharp/double-flat for the next entered note and to sharpen or flatten. Use +/- with the shift key to sharpen or flatten an existing note. Likewise, Shift with a number key edits the duration of a note. </div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-72'>When the cursor is moved on to a note (with the arrow key or mouse) the cursor turns green and then <span style='font-family:monospace;'>a</span> to<span style='font-family:monospace;'> g</span> edits the note name. To insert a note before a note at the cursor use a double strike <span style='font-family:monospace;'>A</span>,<span style='font-family:monospace;'>A</span> to<span style='font-family:monospace;'> G</span>,<span style='font-family:monospace;'>G</span>. When the cursor is green tothe keys<span style='font-family:monospace;'> Shift</span>-<span style='font-family:monospace;'>0</span> to<span style='font-family:monospace;'> Shift-6</span> change the duration of the note, while <span style='font-family:monospace;'>0</span> to<span style='font-family:monospace;'> 6</span> insert a note before the cursor. (If you use the numeric keypad you can use <span style='font-family:monospace;'>Shift-KP0</span> to<span style='font-family:monospace;'> Shift-KP6</span> for this). The arrow keys move the cursor around, the period key adds a dot while <span style='font-family:monospace;'>Alt-a</span> to<span style='font-family:monospace;'> Alt-g</span> add notes to the chord at the cursor. <span style='font-family:monospace;'>Ins</span> inserts a note in a chord whether the cursor is on (green) or after (blue) a note, a double <span style='font-family:monospace;'>Del</span>, <span style='font-family:monospace;'>Del</span> removes it. </div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-73'><div class='Shadowbox'><div class="plain_layout" id='magicparlabel-77'>When in the appending position the cursor shows as a large blue or red rectangle on a note-position. Blue indicates a note can be appended at that point without overflowing the measure. Red indicates that the measure is already full. When the cursor is a smaller green rectangle it indicates that you are not in the appending position: you can edit the note/object at the cursor or insert before it. The vertical blue line indicates the insertion point.</div>
</div></div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-78'>For a more detailed description of Denemo's various input methods, see <a href="#sec_A_Survey_of_Input_Methods">Section 20</a>. You can find more shortcuts by exploring the menu system – e.&thinsp;g. under the Notes/Rests menu the Select Duration submenu gives Remove Dot with the shortcut Control-period shown in blue next to the command. </div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-79'>Alternatively, a list is available in the Help menu. There are thousands of commands in Denemo, so get to know the Command Center<a href="#subsec_The_Command_Center">5</a> where you can search for commands by key words such as slur, ossia, beam, Da Capo, cresc. etc.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-80'>Initially, Denemo starts with tooltips popping up almost everywhere. When they become too annoying you can tame them with Help-&gt;Turn Excessive Tooltips (Off/On), and you can further delay the remaining tooltips appearing via Edit-&gt;Change Preferences.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-81'>And once you have stopped playing around with the mouse for entering notes you can hide the palettes at the side to give more room for the music display (right click and Edit Palette).</div>
<h3 class="subsection" id='magicparlabel-82'><span class="subsection_label">1.1</span> Some Common Keyboard Shortcuts</h3>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-83'>Here are a few of the keyboard shortcuts that are commonly used in Denemo.</div>

<ul class="itemize" id='magicparlabel-84'><li class="itemize_item">Letters <span style='font-family:monospace;'>a</span> to<span style='font-family:monospace;'> g</span> edit the note at the cursor to be A-G, if the cursor is in the appending position then notes are added. Letters <span style='font-family:monospace;'>A-G</span> (either <span style='font-family:monospace;'>CapsLock</span> or <span style='font-family:monospace;'>Shift</span>) tapped twice insert a note at the cursor. </li>
<li class="itemize_item">Numbers <span style='font-family:monospace;'>0 to 6</span> are used to refer to the note durations Whole Note &hellip; 64th Note. They insert a duration at the cursor, which you then give a pitch to with a note name. With the shift key held (or the CapsLock on) <span style='font-family:monospace;'>0 to 6</span> edits the duration of the note at the cursor. The corresponding Numeric Keypad keys can be used instead.</li>
<li class="itemize_item">The period (<span style='font-family:monospace;'>.</span>) dots a note, <span style='font-family:monospace;'>Ctrl-.</span> removes a dot, on the numeric keypad Decimal (.) cycles through dotted, double-dotted, no-dot.</li>
<li class="itemize_item"><span style='font-family:monospace;'>Alt-0 to Alt-6</span> inserts a rest.</li>
<li class="itemize_item"><span style='font-family:monospace;'>Alt-a to Alt-g</span> Add notes to a chord. Or position the cursor and use <span style='font-family:monospace;'>Insert</span> to add a note, <span style='font-family:monospace;'>Ctrl-Insert</span> to remove it. </li>
<li class="itemize_item"><span style='font-family:monospace;'>7</span> starts a slur, <span style='font-family:monospace;'>8</span> extends it, while <span style='font-family:monospace;'>9</span> reduces it.</li>
<li class="itemize_item"><span style='font-family:monospace;'>Shift-/</span> inserts a cautionary accidental.</li>
<li class="itemize_item"><span style='font-family:monospace;'>Esc</span> switches between various views of the music which can allow more music on the screen at once.</li>
<li class="itemize_item"><span style='font-family:monospace;'>TAB</span> alternately inserts a start or stop triplet marker.</li>
<li class="itemize_item">Multiply (<span style='font-family:monospace;'>*</span> on the numeric keypad) ties/unties the note at the cursor.</li>
<li class="itemize_item">Divide (<span style='font-family:monospace;'>/</span> on the numeric keypad) sets/usets the note at the cursor as a grace note.</li>
<li class="itemize_item">Add/Subtract (<span style='font-family:monospace;'>+/-</span> on the numeric keypad) sharpens/flattens the note at the cursor. On the main keyboard <span style='font-family:monospace;'>+/-</span> make the next inserted note sharper/flatter.</li>
</ul>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-96'>Two-key shortcuts are also available such as "<span style='font-family:monospace;'>B</span>,<span style='font-family:monospace;'>s</span>" for start repeat barline<a id='magicparlabel-100' />
 and "<span style='font-family:monospace;'>B</span>,<span style='font-family:monospace;'>e</span>" for end repeat barline. An alternative set of shortcuts for <span style='font-family:monospace;'>a </span>to<span style='font-family:monospace;'> g </span>and<span style='font-family:monospace;'> 0 to 6 </span>is available via the Input menu.</div>
<h3 class="subsection" id='magicparlabel-101'><span class="subsection_label">1.2</span> Some Common Mouse Shortcuts</h3>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-102'>Here are a few of the mouse shortcuts that are commonly used in Denemo (keyboards may vary, for control, shift, alt etc modifiers). Note that under the Input menu is an option to turn on more mouse-friendly buttons, this is the default for Windows users.</div>

<ul class="itemize" id='magicparlabel-103'><li class="itemize_item">Left-button click moves the cursor to the object indicated by the blue circle.</li>
<li class="itemize_item">Scroll Wheel pans up/down to bring staffs out of view into the window.</li>
<li class="itemize_item"><span style='font-family:monospace;'>Shift</span> Key and Scroll Wheel pans the score left/right.</li>
<li class="itemize_item"><span style='font-family:monospace;'>Control</span> Key and Scroll Wheel zooms.</li>
<li class="itemize_item">Right-button click edits at the cursor.</li>
<li class="itemize_item">Double-click brings up the Object Inspector on the current object, from there you can launch the Object Editor.</li>
<li class="itemize_item"><span style='font-family:monospace;'>Shift</span>-right-button click edits things attached to the object at the cursor.</li>
<li class="itemize_item">Double click left-button describes the object clicked on.</li>
<li class="itemize_item"><span style='font-family:monospace;'>Ctrl-Shift</span> left-button drag allow you to move stuff in the display if it is cluttered. Typesettting is not affected.</li>
<li class="itemize_item"><span style='font-family:monospace;'>Ctrl-Shift</span> Key and Right mouse button gives the menu of directives to insert at the cursor.</li>
<li class="itemize_item">Ctrl-left-button drag lets you cramp the measures and/or staffs to a narrower spacing in the Display.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="subsection" id='magicparlabel-114'><span class="subsection_label">1.3</span> Some Common Uses of MIDI in</h3>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-115'>The MIDI keyboard too can be customized to perform different actions. Usually, playing notes adds or edits the score (like hitting note names at the pc-keyboard). With the sustain pedal pressed chords are generated (the Alt key can be used for this too). If the interval between the notes played is augmented or diminished it is played on a different channel, so that you are alerted to possible pitch spelling errors (e.&thinsp;g. inputting A-sharp for B-flat). By holding down the <span style='font-family:monospace;'>Ctrl</span> key a score can be checked by playing the notes – the cursor only advances if the correct note is played, and the <span style='font-family:monospace;'>Shift</span> key can be held down to route the MIDI keyboard straight to the output (e.&thinsp;g. to check a phrase before playing it in). There is a button in the MIDI-in Controls to do this too, as well as a control to set the range of sharps and flats to be used. With the &ldquo;Use Rhythm Entry for MIDI in&rdquo; checked, the duration keys create pure durations (notes colored yellow/brown) – you can enter as much of the rhythm as you wish, and then play the notes on top.</div>
<h3 class="subsection" id='magicparlabel-116'><span class="subsection_label">1.4</span> Note and Rest Entry Palettes</h3>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-117'>On starting Denemo for the very first time a series of palettes are placed near the main window with buttons to insert and change notes. For more serious use these just waste space, so by right clicking on them and choosing Edit this Palette they can be hidden.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-118'><br />
</div>
<h1 class="part" id='magicparlabel-119'><span class="part_label">Part II</span> Using Denemo</h1>
<h2 class="section" id='magicparlabel-120'><span class="section_label">2</span> General Concepts</h2>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-121'>The unit of work in Denemo is a musical score, which can be saved in a single file (with .denemo suffix). This is represented on the screen by a "tab". If you have several tabs open at once they appear just above the music in the main window, and you can switch between them by clicking on the tab.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-122'>One score may contain several movements, which you can move between (<span style='font-family:monospace;'>PgUp</span>, <span style='font-family:monospace;'>PgDown</span>), insert duplicate, merge and delete with the Movements menu. A movement is a <em>continuous</em> piece of music with titles etc.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-123'><div class='Shadowbox'><div class="plain_layout" id='magicparlabel-127'>When you have more than one movement numbered buttons appear in the score titles bar for you to navigate by. The first thing on the status bar after any pending accidental<a id='magicparlabel-131' />
 is the movement number.</div>
</div></div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-132'>In the top corner of the Display is a flag icon which sets values that apply to the whole movement. Here you can control which staffs are visible in the display, which are muted on playback, and edit any other properties of the movment. </div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-133'>Within a movement there are staffs (arranged vertically). Each Denemo Staff has in turn a Denemo Voice<a id='magicparlabel-137' />
 and within the voice are the Denemo Objects. These can be notes, chords, key changes, time signature changes, voice change objects and Denemo Directive objects (see <a href="#sec_Denemo_Directives">Section 32</a>). The staff properties include things like the number of lines (usually 5) the MIDI instrument sound for playback and the amount of space allotted in the display for the staff. Before each staff are buttons to control properties of the staff – flags to set for visibility, mute, non-printing and the staff number which can be clicked to edit other staff properties.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-138'>The notes and chords are displayed in conventional format (though not fully typeset). The position of Denemo Directive objects in the music is marked with a &ldquo;stick and blob&rdquo; and it is accompanied either by a drawing (e.&thinsp;g. of a double barline) and/or some text to describe it. These are used for most things that are not chords or notes etc: Metronome marks, repeat barlines etc are good examples. In this example the caesura is a Denemo Directive object marked by the stick and blob before the last note and drawn on the staff in an approximate representation of its typeset appearance.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-139'><img style='width:60%;' src='images/DenemoDirectives.png' alt='image: images/DenemoDirectives.png' />
</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-140'>Denemo Directives can also be attached to chords, individual notes in a chord, to a staff, to a movement or to the score; in these cases the directive can be thought of as an attribute of the object it is attached to. In the above example the trill sign is attached to the second note and this directive can be inspected and edited using the Object Inspector<a href="#sec_The_Object_Inspector">10</a> and Object Editor <a href="#sec_Object_Editor">11</a>. Denemo Directives attached to the staff, movement or score can be inspected/edited too, using the relevant editors <a href="#sec_The_Score_and">12</a>, <a href="#sec_The_Staff_and">13</a>.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-141'>If there is more than one voice on a staff it is best displayed on a separate staff in the Denemo Display, for ease of editing – the clef is drawn pale and there is no time signature for such extra voices so it is easy to understand what is going on. The Print Preview window as usual shows the final typeset appearance. The clef in this case only affects the display, and any time signature or key signature set on it would also only affect the display.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-142'>In the Denemo display a cursor shows where the next note will be entered/edited. It is red for an over-full bar, blue for appending into an under-full one and green when editing (i.&thinsp;e. on an already entered object).</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-143'>The menus in Denemo are unusual: they not only let you do some particular action, but also each menu item lets you add the command to a palette, enquire what the action does in more detail and set keyboard/mouse shortcuts for the action. A single keystroke can be set as a shortcut simply by pressing the key while the menu item is selected. All the extra functionality of menu items can be accessed by right-clicking the menu item, while the usual left click is for executing the action itself. The menus can always be torn off for working with particular items (e.&thinsp;g. working with different movements or with measures, dynamics etc.). When you place a command in a palette you can add to an existing palette or create a new one – you can choose or create any number of these, free-floating or docked in the main display. Also available by right-clicking is creating new actions – often by modifying ones that are already there – using the Scheme scripting window.</div>



<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-145'>When a file is loaded it opens at the point where you left off editing it. The position and size of the window is restored as well as the position and size of the source pdf you are transcribing from.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-146'><br />
</div>
<h2 class="section" id='magicparlabel-147'><span class="section_label">3</span> Denemo Main Window</h2>

<div class='float-figure'><div class="plain_layout" id='magicparlabel-152'><span class='float-caption-Standard float-caption float-caption-standard'>Figure 1:  Denemo Main Window</span><img style='width:100%;' src='images/denemomain.png' alt='image: images/denemomain.png' />
</div>
</div>


<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-157'>The main window has menus and toolbars at the top, and palettes at top and/or right hand side. Which menus and palettes are shown are selected via the View menu. At the bottom left is a status button showing which movement you are in and what sort of object the Denemo Cursor is on - clicking on this button lets you inspect/edit that object. Bottom right is a command button - it shows the last used command and any messages the commands may have given. Clicking on this button opens the Command Center<a href="#subsec_The_Command_Center">5</a> on the last used command, giving full information about what the command did. The function key Fn12 re-executes the command. When a MIDI filter is active it is displayed at bottom right.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-158'>In between is where the music input is displayed, the Denemo Display area. When zoomed out you see just the few measures you are working on. By dragging the red bar at the bottom of the score upwards you get space for more of the music. If you have many staffs they may not all fit: you can still scroll the display to see several lines of just one or two staffs for instance. </div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-159'>You can hide staffs in the display if needed using the Staffs-&gt;Display Effects menu. If you need more room you can hide the menus (using the View Menu, shortcut Esc key), and arrange a &ldquo;page view&rdquo; of the input music – useful when using playback.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-160'>At the start of each staff are the staff tools: the flag icon lets you set whether the staff will be muted or non-printing and various other properties set on the staff; below that the staff number can be clicked to edit the Denemo Directives which you have installed on the staff. All these are available from the Staff/Voices menu.</div>
<h3 class="subsection" id='magicparlabel-161'><span class="subsection_label">3.1</span> The Denemo Display<a id='magicparlabel-165' />
 </h3>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-166'>The area showing the input music is called the Denemo display. It shows staffs and voices and the music interspersed with any Directives. The background is grayed out when the focus is elsewhere – click on the display to start typing in notes. The background is also colored when input from any attached MIDI keyboard is not being used for appending/editing the score (as it is by default).</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-167'>The default view has a single system stretching off the sides of the window – the actual division into lines and pages for the typeset score is done in the Print View<a href="#sec_The_Print_View">7</a>. In order to see more of the music on the screen at one time you can either cram the staffs and measures closer together (using Ctrl-Left-Drag) or choose from two alternative views you can make where the menus are hidden and/or the display is split into sections. To select these alternate views pressing Esc key twice <div class="foot"><span class="foot_label">1</span><div class="foot_inner"><div class="plain_layout" id='magicparlabel-171'>the command being View-&gt;Hide/Show Menus</div>
</div></div>will switch between three views, two of which have no menus taking up space. At the bottom of any of these is a red line which can be dragged up to split the display into separate lines. Using this you can display more bars of music at the expense of seeing more staffs for each system (the scrolling allows you to choose which staffs to concentrate on). As usual, this division into lines has nothing to do with the typeset view – widening the window will change the positions of the &ldquo;line breaks&rdquo; but have no effect on the final typeset score. Actual line breaks in the typeset are managed by the LilyPond typesetter and can be overruled by commands in the Directives menu.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-172'>The second way of getting to see more of the music is simply to zoom the Denemo Display (Ctrl-mouse wheel is best). Again this is purely for the input display – you use commands in the Score and Directives menu to control the size of staffs, titles etc. in the final typeset score.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-173'>Lastly with large (deep) scores – orchestral scores for instance – you may want to hide staffs in the display while you work on others. For example, you may want to hide all but the woodwind section. The commands for this are in the Staffs menu – you may want to change the keyboard shortcuts for navigating staffs (Ctrl-up arrow etc) to invoke the staff moves that skip over hidden staffs in this case.</div>
<h4 class="subsubsection" id='magicparlabel-174'><span class="subsubsection_label">3.1.1</span> The Page View<a id="subsec_The_Page_View" />
</h4>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-175'>The third of the three Denemo display modes that you get with the Esc key is called the Page View – it is set up initially with a small zoom factor and several systems showing. In this view the cursor highlighting has a large green circle around the cursor position and the display will animate during playback. As the music starts playing the second system down the page the top of the page is &ldquo;turned over&rdquo; so that, as you reach the bottom of the page your eye can move up to the top of the page and follow the music on. Once the music starts again at the top of the new page the rest of the page is filled in replacing the old page.</div>
<h4 class="subsubsection" id='magicparlabel-176'><span class="subsubsection_label">3.1.2</span> Transition Animation</h4>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-177'>One of the problems with moving about a score looking at the input music is that it can be difficult to see quickly where the cursor has moved to. An even more tricky situation arises when deleting empty measures – often the next measure is empty too, so it can appear that nothing has happened, it seems the command to delete a measure isn't working. What has happened is that another empty measure has moved in from the right and the display looks unchanged.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-178'>To avoid these problems these transitions are animated – the measure coming in from the right can be visually seen to shunt in from the side; similarly staffs move up from below and the cursor arrives at its new position by shrinking onto it. All these animation effects (and the page animation of the previous section) can be turned off via View-&gt;Highlight Cursor.</div>
<h3 class="subsection" id='magicparlabel-179'><span class="subsection_label">3.2</span> The Main Menubar</h3>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-180'>The Main Menubar has menus for overall control of the program. The menus on it can be activated from the keyboard by holding down the Alt key, whereon one letter in each menu name is underlined - press that letter to popup the menu, then use the arrow keys to navigate. These are the menu names you see on the menubar:</div>

<h4 class="subsubsection" id='magicparlabel-190'><span class="subsubsection_label">3.2.1</span> File</h4>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-191'>Use the <b>File</b> menu to perform global operations related to storing and retrieving from file systems, importing from MusicXML<a id='magicparlabel-195' />
, MIDI, and LilyPond<a id='magicparlabel-199' />
 formats, printing full score or parts, exporting to MIDI, Ogg, Wav, LilyPond<a id='magicparlabel-203' />
 (parts or score), PDF and Png formats. This is also where you open PDF files containing source material – e.&thinsp;g. manuscripts – that you wish to transcribe or proof-reading comments you wish to incorporate in your score. Another sort of source material can be loaded from here – audio files can be loaded for transcribing as well as MIDI files.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-204'>The New command starts a new score, while New Tab creates an empty score while leaving the current score open – a line of tabs appears at the top of the display for switching between these. Note that you do not have to have multiple scores open to copy and paste<a id='magicparlabel-208' />
 between scores – opening a new score does not alter the clipboard.</div>
<h4 class="subsubsection_" id='magicparlabel-209'>Open Submenu</h4>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-210'>The Open command (Ctrl-o) opens a Denemo file for editing. Open Template opens one of the templates provided with Denemo – this is like open except the file once opened becomes untitled, forcing you to give it a name on saving. Open Example is similar, but here the scores are intended as examples of how to do particular things – they can also serve as a place to copy and paste from. Open Custom Template opens the directory where templates you have created with Save Template are stored. If you create a template called Default.denemo then the command Open Default Template will load it (Ctrl-n). Add Staffs and Add Movements take staffs or movements from the Denemo file chosen and add them to the current score. Open inNew does a combination of New Tab and Open.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-211'>Open Proof Read PDF<a id='magicparlabel-215' />
 is for adding proof reading annotations into your score, see section <a href="#sec_Using_a_Proof_Read">24</a>.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-216'>Open Source for Transcribing allows you to open the source material you are transcribing from so that links can be placed in your score to the relevant place in that document. For more details see the section <a href="#sec_Transcribing_from_Facsimile">21</a></div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-217'>Open recent gives access to a list of recently open scores (you can control how many via the preferences).</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-218'>Open Source Audio loads an audio file creating empty measures with the audio displayed as a series of note-onsets in a line at the top of the display. The note-onsets can be dragged to achieve synchronization and tempo-matching between the notated bars and the audio. You can then add the notes (by ear) and play the two in sync to listen for discrepancies. This is best explained by the video demos (see <a href="www.denemo.org">www.denemo.org</a>).</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-219'>Open Source MIDI opens a MIDI file it comes with comprehensive instructions. Note that many MIDI files are not suitable for transcription – MIDI describes sounds, not notation.</div>
<h4 class="subsubsection" id='magicparlabel-220'><span class="subsubsection_label">3.2.2</span> Navigation</h4>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-221'>This has the commands for moving the cursor around the score, bookmarks, and seeking places in the score by content (&ldquo;search&rdquo;).</div>
<h4 class="subsubsection_" id='magicparlabel-222'>Bookmarks</h4>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-223'>The commands cover finding the next/previous bookmark<a id='magicparlabel-227' />

<h4 class="subsubsection_" id='magicparlabel-228'>Cursor</h4>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-229'>This includes moving the cursor by measure, staff, and within a chord. There are moves that skip staffs that are hidden in the display and ones that skip over staffs that are voice<a id='magicparlabel-233' />
s to move to the next primary staff.</div>
<h4 class="subsubsection_" id='magicparlabel-234'>Seek</h4>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-235'>This has a commands to search for rhythmic patterns, note sequences, empty measures, next higher/lower note, empty measures &hellip; The search facility includes the equivalent of &ldquo;search and replace&rdquo;: by recording a sequence of edits in the Scheme Window, the searched for items can be edited by choosing the Execute Scheme option when found.</div>
<h4 class="subsubsection_" id='magicparlabel-236'>MIDI</h4>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-237'>These are commands to move along the note onsets in an imported MIDI file (guided MIDI import).</div>
<h4 class="subsubsection" id='magicparlabel-238'><span class="subsubsection_label">3.2.3</span> Edit</h4>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-239'>The <b>Edit</b> menu collects command for editing: mostly editing objects in the display, the <a href="#sec_Denemo_Objects">Section 31</a>but also editing global properties of the score and your preferences. </div>
<h5 class="paragraph" id='magicparlabel-240'><span class="paragraph_label"></span> Edit-&gt;Delete Submenu</h5>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-241'>There are commands for deleting the object before the cursor, the object at the cursor and for partially deleting from the object at the cursor (e.&thinsp;g. deleting notes from chords). Other delete commands are in the Object Menubar menus (deleting movements, staffs, measures etc).</div>
<h5 class="paragraph" id='magicparlabel-242'><span class="paragraph_label"></span> Edit-&gt;Select Submenu</h5>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-243'>This menu has commands for creating and editing a selection of the music: a selection can begin and end at any object in a single staff or can be a range of measures in adjacent staffs.</div>
<h5 class="paragraph" id='magicparlabel-244'><span class="paragraph_label"></span> Edit-&gt;Object at Cursor Submenu</h5>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-245'>Invoking an Editor for the object at the cursor is done from this menu, as well as editing the LilyPond syntax to be generated for the current object. For example when creating a piano edition for players with smaller hands it is possible to modify the notes of a chord, making the changed syntax conditional on which edition you wish to typeset. Or where the left hand part of a piano piece is to be typeset for cello it is possible to insert tenor clefs where needed with a &ldquo;Hide&rdquo; directive guarded by an inclusion criterion which might be named &ldquo;pianoforte&rdquo; in this case. Setting any Denemo Directive attached to an object at the cursor to be conditional can be done from this menu - for example if fingerings attached to notes are not to be printed then they can be made conditional on a layout or specific to some Inclusion Criterion<a href="#sec_Inclusion_Criteria">14.1</a> set on the fingering.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-246'>There are commands for editing all the Denemo Objects of a chosen type across the whole of a score. Commands for managing the<em> selection<a id='magicparlabel-250' />
 </em>are also here. Editing using the keyboard to invoke a palette button is here too (usual shortcut is <span style='font-family:monospace;'>p</span>).</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-251'>Here, too, you invoke editing the Preferences<a id='magicparlabel-255' />

<h4 class="subsubsection_" id='magicparlabel-261'>Copy/Cut and Paste<a id='magicparlabel-265' />
</h4>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-266'>The usual shortcuts (<span style='font-family:monospace;'>Ctrl-c Ctrl-x Ctrl-v</span>) are set by default operating on the <em>selection</em> <a id='magicparlabel-270' />
. With no selection the Copy command copies an attribute attached to the note/chord at the cursor, such as an ornament or fingering. If there is more than one attribute set you are asked to choose which to copy. If there are none, the object at the cursor is copied. In all cases <em>the copied item is highlighted in green </em>so you can be sure that your keypress has been &ldquo;heard&rdquo;.</div>
<h4 class="subsubsection_" id='magicparlabel-271'>Select submenu</h4>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-272'>Here are commands for selection parts of the music (e.g. for cut and paste, or to apply a command to the selection). Here selected music can be <em>spanned</em> by being bracketed with a pair of Denemo Directives. A special case of this is creating a passage<a id='magicparlabel-276' />
 which can then be swapped with the corresponding music in the staff below using a command in the NotationMagick menu.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-347'>Use the <b>Input</b> menu to select external sources (Audio from the Mic input or MIDI) for inputting notes to Denemo. To use these you should review the settings in Edit-&gt;Change Preferences MIDI and audio tabs first – you may need to change the setting for the backend from &ldquo;default&rdquo; to the specific controller you have. Note that on some systems changing to a specific audio output will mean that Denemo hogs that output - generally you should choose &ldquo;default&rdquo; and use your operating system controls to determine what the default is.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-348'>Here too there are commands to change the way the inputs (keyboard, mouse and MIDI) behave.</div>

<h4 class="subsubsection" id='magicparlabel-351'><span class="subsubsection_label">3.2.7</span> Playback/Record</h4>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-352'>Use the <b>Playback/Record</b> menu to listen to the current movement. Denemo lets you hear your score, using an internal synthesizer. There are commands to play through the all the notes or to observe repeats or to play just the chord or notes at the cursor and to play at a shifted pitch. The default playback is quick and simple rendering of the music – good for checking pitch and rhythm. For more sophisticated playback open the Playback View<a href="#sec_The_Playback_View">9</a> where the playback happens on a fully typeset score.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-353'>Playback uses a pair of marks to decide where to start and stop playing. These appear in the display as vertical green and red lines down through the notes concerned <em>when the playback control panel is visible</em>. These markers can be moved about by the arrow buttons on either side of the play button in the Playback Controls <a href="#subsec_Playback_Controls">3.4</a> and they are set for you by the Play from Cursor to End, Play Music at Cursor, Performance and other commands in this menu.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-354'>The Recording submenu allows you to record what is being played back and either save it to disk or attach it at the timing of the note at the cursor.</div>

</h4>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-360'>There are games and exercises to help learn notation and to improve your recognition of intervals. Mostly quite simple, but a more sophisticated example is a command that loads Handel's figured bass exercises and allows you to try them out, recording your playing and then reporting on any parallel intervals. Teachers with an interest in programming can create further games using the Scheme window and save them for use by their pupils.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-448'>Recording the audio output is also possible as well as real-time slow down of the audio playing back (not to be confused with simply setting a slower tempo!). This last is used when transcribing from audio (See File-&gt;Open-&gt;Open Source Audio).</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-449'>While playing back the note(s) being played are highlighted – the page view mode<a href="#subsec_The_Page_View">3.1.1</a> of the Denemo Display is useful for letting you follow the music in the input display.

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-471'><div class='Shadowbox'><div class="plain_layout" id='magicparlabel-475'>Note: Dynamics, Slurs, Trills, Tempo Indications etc are in the Notes/Rests menu (if attached to a note or chord) or Directives menu (if standalone objects) . The advantage of attaching them to a note is that they can be moved around as a unit, but the standalone objects are generally easier to drag in the Print View should that be needed.</div>
</div></div>
<h4 class="subsubsection" id='magicparlabel-476'><span class="subsubsection_label">3.6.1</span> Score Menu</h4>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-477'>The score menu lets you control things that apply to all the movements of the current score. Also here is the Check Score command which should be your first port of call if your score will not typeset.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-478'>The Score Properties command gives access to some built-in properties that affect the whole piece – paper size and display apperance. </div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-479'>The Score Properties Editor command runs the <a href="#sec_The_Score_and">12</a>Score and Movement Properties Editor, open on the Score Editor pane.</div>
<h4 class="subsubsection_" id='magicparlabel-480'>Titles<a id='magicparlabel-484' />
 Submenu</h4>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-485'>There are two sorts of titles. Book titles have a separate title page with titles for individual movements which can be listed in an automatically generated table of contents. Simple titles give a Title and (optionally) movement titles on the same page. </div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-486'>Comments (&ldquo;Critical Comments&rdquo;) can be placed on chords/notes/rests in the score and these can be automatically collected into an appendix using the Book Titles-&gt;Epilog submenu.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-487'>A Table of Contents can be automatically generated from the movement titles by setting Book Titles-&gt;Table of Contents Title.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-488'>Graphic title pages can also be created. These can be created by invoking the Inkscape vector graphics editor from within Denemo, or using it externally to create the title page. A sample title page is included both as an encapsulated postcript (EPS) file and as a scalable vector graphics (SVG) file. The latter is the form to use for editing the page to suit your needs, but it should also be saved as an EPS file as this is the format used to include it in the typeset score.</div>
<h4 class="subsubsection_" id='magicparlabel-489'>Typesetter Submenu</h4>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-490'>Here such things as the overall font size to typeset the score, the rules for spacing systems and titles, any global transposition, control of page numbering, margins etc can be set.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-491'>The beaming<a id='magicparlabel-495' />
 rules can be set both in general (invoke Set Beaming Rules without a selection) or with exceptions (by invoking with a selection that has been beamed manually using the [ and ] commands from the Notes/Rests-&gt;Beaming menu). Use this latter to break up very short notes, for example, that would otherwise be beamed together while leaving the longer durations as normal.</div>
<h4 class="subsubsection" id='magicparlabel-496'><span class="subsubsection_label">3.6.2</span> Movements Menu</h4>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-497'>As with the Score Menu there may be Denemo Directives attached to the movement – e.g titles<a id='magicparlabel-501' />
 to be placed at the head of the movement will have a Denemo Directive associated with them. Other controls that can be applied on a per-movement basis include the barline<a id='magicparlabel-505' />
 and notehead style, printing of a custos at line ends, the indent<a id='magicparlabel-509' />
 before the first system (which can also be set on the score-wide basis).</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-510'>Various score checking routines work at movement level from this menu and a command to re-bar the movment (or a staff or part of a staff) is also here as &ldquo;Adjust the Measure Lengths&rdquo; – this can also be used just to check that the Denemo &ldquo;measures&rdquo; correspond with the actual typeset measures (which always follow the durations/time signatures) or to re-bar a staff or passage or movement if you have changed your mind or got out of step.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-511'>Again there are titles menus for either simple or book titles, and for inserting graphics between movements. These can be used as decorative separators between movements or to insert columns of verses at the end of songs (each song is a separate &ldquo;movement&rdquo;).</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-512'>The Typesetter submenu for the Movements Menu holds commands that affect the current movement: per-movement transposition, inserting blank pages<a id='magicparlabel-516' />
 (to avoid page turns), page breaks<a id='magicparlabel-520' />
, custos<a id='magicparlabel-524' />
 at the end of lines, note head style to apply to the whole movement, behavior of staffs that are resting for an entire system etc. Also here is a command to allow <em>polymetric staffs</em><a id='magicparlabel-528' />
. When set time signatures can differ between staffs, and barlines do not have to align across an entire system. Denemo's display copes with showing polymetric staffs on the whole, though you may need to use Measures-&gt;Hidden Measure to even up staffs in the display and mark measures with Measures-&gt;Ignore Measure Duration Error to prevent them being colored in the display.</div>
<h4 class="subsubsection" id='magicparlabel-529'><span class="subsubsection_label">3.6.3</span> <a id='magicparlabel-533' />
Staff/Voices Menu</h4>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-534'>Things such as the music crossing to another staff, or Ossia<a id='magicparlabel-538' />
 staffs are contained here, along with commands for deleting parts of the staff, setting up multi-measure rests for a whole staff, muting the staff during playback, </div>
<h4 class="subsubsection_" id='magicparlabel-539'>The Staff Properties<a id='magicparlabel-543' />
 Submenu</h4>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-544'>This covers such things as the type of staff (e.&thinsp;g. Normal Notation, Tablature, Chord Symbols, Fret Diagrams) as well as the staff appearance and the playback instrument, instrument name or ambitus to be typeset at the start of the staff and more.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-545'>For historical reasons, some properties such as part-name are &ldquo;built-in&rdquo; and have their own dialog to set the values. All can be accessed from the Staff Properties Editor<a id='magicparlabel-549' />
 from this menu.</div>
<h4 class="subsubsection_" id='magicparlabel-550'>The Add Staff Submenu</h4>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-551'>This allows adding staffs to the current movement. Piano staffs can be added as well as specialized sorts of staff for dynamics<a id='magicparlabel-555' />
, marks (so that they appear once for all layouts), and coulés (diagonal lines positioned between thirds in some music). The Add Structured Staff command duplicates the current staff with regard to measures and time signature changes, ready for the insertion of music. Add Staff for Instrument allows you to add the staff(s) needed for various instruments (e.&thinsp;g. organ) with the ranges of acceptable notes for the instrument set on the staff(s). In the MIDI sub-sub-menu are commands to add a click track<a id='magicparlabel-559' />
 (a staff which does not typeset but contains clicks on each beat which are played with the score) and to add staffs for imported MIDI tracks.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-560'>Staffs with &ldquo;mirrored&rdquo; music can also be added. In this case the staff does not have music of its own, instead the music mirrors that in another staff. By setting the part-name<a id='magicparlabel-564' />
 on such a staff a greater variety of parts can be printed from one score without needing to create a custom layout<a id='magicparlabel-568' />
 for them. For example, two flute parts can be printed separately and as a combined (&ldquo;divisi&rdquo;) part, using the same music. Any marks etc that need to be handled differently can be made conditional<a id='magicparlabel-572' />
 on the part name.</div>
<h4 class="subsubsection_" id='magicparlabel-573'>The Voices<a id='magicparlabel-577' />
 Submenu</h4>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-578'><em>Voices</em> in Denemo are like staffs but are typeset on the preceding staff to achieve single-staff polyphony. The Denemo Display is normally set to display any extra voices on a separate staff so as to make it easy to work with – the voices have their clef<a id='magicparlabel-582' />
 displayed in yellow and do not show a key signature<a id='magicparlabel-586' />
 as these are supplied by the main staff (or &ldquo;primary voice&rdquo;). Voices will also normally be assigned to voice numbers 1,2,3,4 using the Initial Voice commands in this menu (this controls the stemming, slur positions etc). Voices can change their voice number during the music – the commands for this are in the Directives-&gt;Typesetter-&gt;Voices menu as they insert stem change objects in between the notes.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-587'>As with staffs, voices can be created with no music of their own, simply mirroring music from another staff.</div>
<h4 class="subsubsection_" id='magicparlabel-588'>The Playback Submenu<a id='magicparlabel-592' />
</h4>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-593'>In this menu you can mute the staff, apply custom durations to notes and arrange that grace notes are given a custom duration rather than having a zero duration which they have by default. Use this menu to give the Denemo playback a jazz swing effect or to playback with inégalité. These custom durations do not affect the typesetting nor the Playback View<a href="#sec_The_Playback_View">9</a> (which uses MIDI generated by LilyPond).</div>
<h4 class="subsubsection_" id='magicparlabel-594'>The Display<a id='magicparlabel-598' />
 Effects Submenu</h4>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-599'>Here you can choose to hide staffs from the display so that you can see distantly placed staffs side by side (e.&thinsp;g. in large orchestral scores). The location of such &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; staffs<a id='magicparlabel-603' />
 is indicated by a colored line between the staffs above and below. The staffs remain hidden until you move the cursor on to them. If you are using this and navigating with the keyboard you may want to reset the key shortcuts for staff navigation commands to use variants that skip over the hidden staffs. Some staffs (e.g Click Track<a id='magicparlabel-607' />
 are hidden by default as you do not normally edit them.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-608'>You can also give more/less room in the display to the staffs via this menu.</div>
<h4 class="subsubsection_" id='magicparlabel-609'>The Staff Groupings (Braces) Submenu<a id='magicparlabel-613' />
</h4>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-614'>The braces at the start of each system are controlled from here. The order that you add the braces determines which are outside which. The braces are displayed to the left of the staff and can be edited/checked there with the mouse.</div>
<h4 class="subsubsection" id='magicparlabel-615'><span class="subsubsection_label">3.6.4</span> Clefs<a id='magicparlabel-619' />
 Menu</h4>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-620'>All sorts of clefs can be selected – the Set Initial and Clef Change commands give access to standard clefs. The Clef Chooser command lets you set more exotic clefs such as Drum clef and even things like the Gregorian chant C clef using the LilyPond syntax (e.&thinsp;g. vaticana-do3).</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-621'>Typeset-only and Display-only clefs enable you to work with a voice<a id='magicparlabel-625' />
 which is being typeset on a different staff, while keeping the music in the staff you wish to see it in or for entering music in a familiar staff which is to be typeset in an unfamiliar one.</div>
<h4 class="subsubsection" id='magicparlabel-626'><span class="subsubsection_label">3.6.5</span> Keys Menu<a id='magicparlabel-630' />
</h4>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-631'>Setting the initial key or a key signature change or to sharpen or flatten the key signature at the cursor. You can also click on the key signature itself to sharpen/flatten. The key signature can be hidden when typeset.</div>
<h4 class="subsubsection" id='magicparlabel-632'><span class="subsubsection_label">3.6.6</span> Time Signatures Menu<a id='magicparlabel-636' />
s Menu</h4>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-637'>Besides basic time signatures various variants (numeric, single digit &hellip;) are here. There is also beaming<a id='magicparlabel-641' />
 control applying just to the current passage (for beaming rules for the whole score see the Score-&gt;Typesetter menu or for the whole movement Movement-&gt;Typesetter menu).</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-642'>Cadenza Time allows un-metered music to by typeset conveniently. While in Cadenza Time no barlines except ones you explicitly place are typeset, and no beaming is done except where you explicitly set beaming indications. You can use as many Denemo &ldquo;bars&rdquo; as you find convenient – they will not cause barlines to be typeset. Other parts have to be given Cadenza Time too, and filled with non-printing rests to match the duration of the music being typeset.</div>
<h4 class="subsubsection" id='magicparlabel-643'><span class="subsubsection_label">3.6.7</span> Measures Menu<a id='magicparlabel-647' />
<a id='magicparlabel-651' />
 Menu</h4>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-660'>Besides commands to insert/delete/navigate/merge/split measures (in one or all staffs) this menu includes commands to set an upbeat<a id='magicparlabel-664' />
<a id='magicparlabel-668' />
<a id='magicparlabel-672' />
 (anacrusis, pickup) measure at the start, or a short measure (e.&thinsp;g. during partial first &amp; second time bars). First and second time bars markers themselves are to be found in the Directives-&gt;Markings-&gt;Spanning menu<a id='magicparlabel-676' />
 .</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-677'>The whole measure repeat sign is here and some commands to check the measure for errors or to widen or narrow the measure in the display.</div>
<h4 class="subsubsection" id='magicparlabel-678'><span class="subsubsection_label">3.6.8</span> Chords<a id='magicparlabel-682' />
 Menu</h4>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-683'>Here are commands to add notes to a chord either at the cursor, by note name or at an interval above the bass. Whole chords can have their enharmonic spelling changed up or down.</div>
<h4 class="subsubsection" id='magicparlabel-684'><span class="subsubsection_label">3.6.9</span> Notes/Rests Menu<a id='magicparlabel-688' />
<a id='magicparlabel-692' />
</h4>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-693'>This covers inserting, deleting and modifying notes in pitch, duration and appearance and all sorts of things that are attached to note objects such as slurs<a id='magicparlabel-697' />
, phrasing slurs, ties<a id='magicparlabel-701' />
, beaming<a id='magicparlabel-705' />
 controls, ornaments<a id='magicparlabel-709' />
 (trill, turn, &hellip;), grace notes, articulations<a id='magicparlabel-713' />
 (staccato, tenuto &hellip;), fingerings<a id='magicparlabel-717' />
, textual markings<a id='magicparlabel-721' />
, cresc. and dim.<a id='magicparlabel-725' />
 (both hairpins and extended cresc. — poco — a — poco style) chord symbols<a id='magicparlabel-729' />
 (&ldquo;fake chords&rdquo;<a id='magicparlabel-733' />
), figured bass. Dynamic markings such as <em>f </em>and<em> p </em>are separate objects (see Directives-&gt;Markings-&gt;Dynamics<a id='magicparlabel-745' />
). </div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-746'>Also here is the tuplet<a id='magicparlabel-750' />
 menu, for groups of notes that have a duration that is a fraction of the written duration, such as triplets. These actually insert tuplet start and end objects, before and after the notes concerned so, strictly speaking they should come in a separate miscellaneous objects category. As usual, the most useful commands have shortcuts already – Tab starts/stops a triplet alternately (so you can press it once, enter the notes and press it again to finish the triplet). And the two key shortcut Keypad 7, Keypad 7 turns the note entered into a triplet of notes (with Control as well they are slurred). This is set as a two-key shortcut so that you can type it in as a triplet rhythm: e.&thinsp;g. the three keypresses 4, KP_7, KP_7 will give a triplet of three 1/16th notes.</div>
<h4 class="subsubsection_" id='magicparlabel-751'>The Append/Edit Note Submenu<a id='magicparlabel-755' />
</h4>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-756'>So called because in appending position the note names a, b, c &hellip; append a note while when the cursor is on an note it edits the note to have the note-name indicated. The other note edit commands here are shifting up and down an octave, sharpening or flattening. Cautionary and reminder accidentals are here too – to set the style of accidentals (e.&thinsp;g. if they are repeated in various circumstances) see the Score-&gt;Typesetter menu.</div>
<h4 class="subsubsection_" id='magicparlabel-757'>The Note Insertion Submenu</h4>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-758'>This menu has commands for inserting notes at (i.&thinsp;e. before the object at) the cursor position. The double key press A, A inserts the note A in the prevailing duration (more commonly people press a duration key 0, 1, &hellip; followed by a note name).</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-759'>If you enter a note and then sharpen you will hear both note and sharpened note – to avoid this use the &ldquo;Sharpen Next Note&rdquo; command (likewise for flatten, use twice for double-sharp,flat) the default key presses are '=' and '-' for these.</div>
<h4 class="subsubsection_" id='magicparlabel-760'>The Append/Insert Duration<a id='magicparlabel-764' />
 Submenu</h4>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-765'>So called because the commands 0, 1, 2 &hellip; append a note when the cursor is in the appending position or enter a note if the cursor is on an object. If you have a MIDI keyboard (and it is designated in the preferences under the MIDI tab) then the note will be purely rhythmic (yellow/brown) playing a pitch will turn it into a real note. Here is the command for entering a snippet (which can be a complete rhythmic pattern) as well as Breve and Longa for early music.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-766'>There are also a set of comands for appending notes which will be slurred from previous notes (Control-0, etc) which means that you can enter slurs as you enter the rhythm of a bar without extra key presses (which would otherwise break the rhythm of your entry).</div>
<h4 class="subsubsection_" id='magicparlabel-767'>The Edit Duration<a id='magicparlabel-771' />
 Submenu</h4>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-772'>Here are the commands for changing the duration of the note/rest/chord<a id='magicparlabel-776' />
 at the cursor as well as doubling or dividing the note at the cursor.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-777'>Besides commands for dotting notes there are commands for turning the note at the cursor into a dotted rhythm of two notes and for entering a dotted rhythm with two key presses (so as to keep in rhythm – e.&thinsp;g. 3, KP_9 gives dotted 1/8 note, 1/16th note, and the corresponding slurred one with Control).</div>
<h4 class="subsubsection_" id='magicparlabel-778'>The Rest Insertion Submenu<a id='magicparlabel-782' />
</h4>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-783'>Besides inserting rests (Alt-0 etc) you can insert non-printing rests (where voice<a id='magicparlabel-787' />
s are silent) and move rests out of the way in polyphonic situations where LilyPond doesn't do what you want. Whole measure rest<a id='magicparlabel-791' />
s and multi-measure rest<a id='magicparlabel-795' />
s are here too with control over their numbering.</div>
<h4 class="subsubsection_" id='magicparlabel-796'>The Select Duration<a id='magicparlabel-800' />
 Submenu</h4>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-801'>The commands to explicitly set the prevailing duration are here (though usually this is set by inserting a duration) and, more importantly the command to select a snippet as the prevailing duration (Shift+ Space) after which entered notes follow the pattern of the snippet.</div>
<h4 class="subsubsection" id='magicparlabel-802'><span class="subsubsection_label">3.6.10</span> Directives Menu<a id='magicparlabel-806' />
<a id="subsec_Directives" />
 </h4>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-807'>This covers all the things that aren't notes but sit in between them – <em>standalone</em> Denemo Directives. The most useful for regular music notation are barlines, dynamic markings, tempo<a id='magicparlabel-811' />
 marks, rehearsal marks etc in the Markings submenu. There is an enormous collection of stuff here though.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-812'>All objects, including Denemo Directives can be inspected and edited via the Object Editor</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-813'>One general feature is the Conditional Directives<a id='magicparlabel-817' />
 which can be used to restrict a directive to a particular type of score layout<a id='magicparlabel-821' />
 (e.&thinsp;g. only to be used when printing a part, or a full score). This can be used, for example, to prevent a cue being printed on the full score (as it is only relevant when printing the part).</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-822'>Note there is a further class of Denemo Directives, the ones <em>attached</em> to notes/chords/staffs/movements/scores – these direct the typesetter to do special things such as attach fingerings, ornaments etc. Denemo Directives are described in a separate section<a href="#sec_Inclusion_Criteria">14.1</a>.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-834'>Inserts special syntax to skip the number of notes you currently have selected in the Denemo Display.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-835'>This is useful if you have a musical introduction or interlude in a song. </div>
<h6 class="subparagraph_" id='magicparlabel-836'>Insert Stanza Number</h6>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-837'>Asks you for some text (usually the number of the verse) and inserts the special syntax to typeset this before the next syllable, leaving the syllable position undisturbed. Normally the lyric cursor should be at the stanza/verse start.</div>
<h6 class="subparagraph_" id='magicparlabel-838'>Syllable Alignment</h6>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-839'>Inserts special syntax to cause the text to be aligned with its start or end below the note (rather than the default centered position). This may be useful for chanted text.</div>
<h6 class="subparagraph_" id='magicparlabel-840'>Melismata</h6>

<ul class="itemize" id='magicparlabel-841'><li class="itemize_item">During Word, with Slur – The typeset score will print hyphen(s), if needed, showing continuation to the end of the slur </li>

<h6 class="subparagraph_" id='magicparlabel-848'>Insert Mirrored Verse</h6>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-849'>permits a mirrored copy of a verse from another stave to be included on the currrent staff, for example when the words for two parts are the same but on separate staffs. Then if the words need editing, just the first copy needs to be changed. </div>
<h6 class="subparagraph_" id='magicparlabel-850'>Lyric Tie</h6>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-851'>Inserts the syntax to separate two words which should be typeset under one note. </div>
<h6 class="subparagraph_" id='magicparlabel-852'>Dynamic </h6>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-853'>Inserts a dynamic marking (ff, f, p, or pp) directly in the lyrics. You can edit the insert for other dynamics.</div>
<h6 class="subparagraph_" id='magicparlabel-854'>Typeset Verses at End</h6>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-855'>This takes several verses and uses the Movement-&gt;Titles-&gt;Text after Movement command to typeset them at the end of the movement arranging them in columns.You are given a choice as to which verse to start from. Normally you would then delete these verses from the staff so they are not repeated. Issuing the command a second time allows you to delete, replace or edit the end-of-movement text.</div>
<h6 class="subparagraph_" id='magicparlabel-856'>Change Font</h6>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-857'>Inserts a change the font for the lyrics from the current lyric cursor position. Short forms such as Sans, Times can be used.</div>

<a id="sec_Palettes" />
</h2>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-869'>Palettes are collections of commands arranged as a column, row or grid of buttons either in a separate window or docked in the Main Window. </div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-870'>The buttons are not just for mouse users – palette buttons can be executed by typing <span style='font-family:monospace;'>p</span> followed by (part of) the label of the button followed by the <span style='font-family:monospace;'>Enter <em>or</em> Return</span> key. The entry for keying in a palette label looks like this:</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-872'>At the top is the name of the palette that is active, in this case the &ldquo;General&rdquo; palette. You can switch to a different palette with TAB – the palette does not have to be displayed on the screen, but if you type a label that does not exist it will be shown to remind you.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-873'>To make full use of the keyboard for executing commands from your palettes you should edit the labels so that they are easy to type &amp; memorable. Put the shorter ones first as you do not need to type all of the label, just enough to select the needed button. Right-clicking on a palette button allows you to edit the button, changing the label or tooltip, duplicating the button (e.&thinsp;g. to create an edited version of its script) and more, as in the following popup:</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-874'><img style='width:60%;' src='images/PaletteMenu.png' alt='image: images/PaletteMenu.png' />
</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-875'>You can also edit the palette itself by right clicking on any button and choosing the Edit this Palette submenu (shown open above). You can make the palette fill up horizontally or vertically and restrict the number of columns/rows respectively. You can dock/undock palettes as well and hide palettes that are not needed (you can also hide undocked palettes by dismissing their window).</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-876'>In the View menu you can select a palettes of commands to display or show all the palettes and then hide the ones you don't want.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-877'>You should make palettes your best friend – when you find a command in the menu system that you need right click on it and choose Add to Palette. This way you will build up one or more collections of commands that you need. </div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-878'>Palette buttons can also be created directly from objects or Denemo Directives so that you can duplicate them in your score without having to copy and paste. So, for example if you run Help-&gt;Open Feature Packed Score and find the type of object or attribute you need there then you can run the Object Inspector or one of the editors on it and create a palette button for installing the same thing in your own score. See the sections <a href="#sec_The_Object_Inspector">10</a><a href="#sec_Object_Editor">11</a> <a href="#sec_The_Score_and">12</a><a href="#sec_The_Staff_and">13</a>for more details.</div>

</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1014'>In the View menu you can show the Command Center. This has a list of all the Denemo commands, hidden or not, with their shortcut(s). The box at the top left gives full details of the currently selected command and its location in the menu system. Below that is a search box for finding any command you need by matching words in its description or label. By choosing &ldquo;Fuzzy&rdquo; you will make the search less strict – one word could be missing.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1015'>The search<a id='magicparlabel-1019' />
 starts once you have typed the fourth letter of any key words you want, so check after each letter to see if you have found the command you need.

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1020'>The command center is also where you can set one-key shortcuts such as <span style='font-family:monospace;'>Ctrl-x</span> and two-key shortcuts such as <span style='font-family:monospace;'>Shift-a</span> followed by <span style='font-family:monospace;'>Shift-a</span> (which is written as <span style='font-family:monospace;'>A</span>,<span style='font-family:monospace;'>A</span> next to the command).

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1021'>In addition you can save and load whole sets of shortcuts and commands. If you have upgraded your version of Denemo and you have elected to keep your customized commands etc then you should run the Load a Standard Command Set choosing Default.commands, as some commands may have moved in the menu system. If there are new palettes in an upgraded version of Denemo then you can get them merged in with your own palettes by clicking &ldquo;Load the Standard Palette Set&rdquo; – this does not overwrite any palette buttons you may have, so delete any customised buttons (after duplicating, if desired) that you wish to fetch from the Denemo distribution.</div>

</h2>
<h3 class="subsection" id='magicparlabel-1027'><span class="subsection_label">6.1</span> Overview</h3>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1028'>Music snippets are short selections from a voice which can be stored on the Snippet tool bar. They have two main uses: they can act as a repository of &ldquo;motifs&rdquo; which can be inserted (<span style='font-family:monospace;'>Ctrl-Space</span>) at the cursor, and they can be used as an extension to the &ldquo;prevailing duration&rdquo; idea. In the second use, by selecting a snippet as you enter pitches the durations are assigned from the next step in the snippet. The first case is especially useful when entering a complex rhythm which is repeated many times in the piece. In all cases the snippet can contain all sorts of attributes and markings, slurs, beaming indications, ornaments etc, and these will then all be entered with a single keypress or as you add pitches.</div>
<h3 class="subsection" id='magicparlabel-1029'><span class="subsection_label">6.2</span> Details</h3>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1030'>The Snippet tool bar has only one button initially: &ldquo;Create&rdquo;. This button lets you create a snippet from the current selection. The selection should be a contiguous selection of objects in a single voice. Once created the snippet appears on the snippet tool bar as a button – the label is generated to indicate the content, and this label can be further edited by clicking on the button and choosing &ldquo;Edit Label&rdquo;. Other options on clicking a snippet button are to insert the snippet, to select the snippet (in which case as you enter pitches they follow the rhythm of the snippet, including any slurs, trills, or articulations that are in the snippet) etc. </div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1031'><span style='font-family:monospace;'>Ctrl-Space </span>inserts the selected snippet or (if none is selected) inserts the snippet that you specify by number. <span style='font-family:monospace;'>Shift-Space</span> selects the next snippet (or first if none selected), to unselect a snippet choose a duration (0, 1 &hellip;) to be used instead for entering pitches.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1032'>In the insertion case, you may have two or three snippets that apply to a given score – special bits of text that appear over notes for example – and you can insert them using <span style='font-family:monospace;'>Ctrl-Space</span>, 1 (or 2 or 3 &hellip;) as needed.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1033'>In the pattern-following case you will be selecting snippets using <span style='font-family:monospace;'>Shift-Space</span> and then playing in notes (and backing up using backspace in case of error – the pattern backs up for you).</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1040'>The print view window is shown by checking View-&gt;Print View. This view shows the typeset score as it will be printed on paper.

<ul class="itemize" id='magicparlabel-1042'><li class="itemize_item">Print starts your system's print dialog to send the typeset score to a printer or file. Windows print dialog has been reported to crash, if so use the PDF option.</li>
<li class="itemize_item">PDF<a id='magicparlabel-1047' />
 to generate a PDF document from the score.</li>
<li class="itemize_item">Typeset. Offers a menu of score layouts<a id='magicparlabel-1052' />
 to typeset. If only one is available (the Default Score Layout) then it typesets that one.</li>
<li class="itemize_item">Movement. Creates a Score Layout comprising the current movement, and then typesets it .</li>
<li class="itemize_item">Part. Creates a Score Layout from the current Part and typesets that. A <em>part </em>comprises all the staffs with the part name of the current staff. (The part name of a staff is shown above the initial clef with a green patch on it).</li>
<li class="itemize_item">Refresh. Repeats that last typeset command. For example, if Part was the last then it typesets the current part (which may be different from the one last typeset if the cursor is in a different part).</li>
<li class="itemize_item">Inclusion Criteria. This button is labelled either &ldquo;No Inclusion Criterion Set&rdquo; or with the name of an Inclusion Criterion. With it you can create an Inclusion criterion and set it to control the typesetting of the score - see Inclusion Criteria<a href="#sec_Inclusion_Criteria">14.1</a>.</li>
<li class="itemize_item">Continuous/Manual. This both indicates the current mode of typesetting and acts as a menu for altering it and choosing how much to typeset in continuous mode. In continuous mode the score is re-typeset every time it is altered – choose the range if the score is large so that it refreshes quickly. For entering music rapidly set this to Manual, and re-typeset on demand.
<br />



<ul class="itemize" id='magicparlabel-1058'><li class="itemize_item">Range opens the range dialog. You can set the range by selecting &ldquo;All Movements&rdquo;, &ldquo;Current Movement&rdquo; or &ldquo;Cursor Context&rdquo;. In this last one you can select the number of bars before and after the cursor and the number of staffs above and below the cursor to typeset. Note that if you select too small a range the typesetting may be different, as the small amount of music will be spaced differently to appear well typeset.</li>
</ul>
</li><li class="itemize_item">Duplex. Changes the view to show how two-sided printing will work out for page turns.</li>

 Controls<a id="subsec_Mouse_Controls" />
</h3>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1066'>The mouse scroll wheel enables vertical panning and with Shift horizontal panning. With Control pressed you can zoom the view, which is very important for re-shaping slurs. Right click for help with tweaking beam angles, slurs etc.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1067'>Shift-Clicking on a notehead or marking selects the object (blue box appears) and positions the Denemo cursor at that point so that you can start editing. Clicking without shift starts playing at that point – click again to stop the play.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1068'>Right clicking in a blank area of the typeset view (normal cursor) gives a menu providing help and allowing you to typeset with the control points for curves and the location points of objects marked as red dots and crosses. Be sure to turn off these red dots and crosses before printing or creating a customized score layout, as they are embedded in the score and will print.</div>
<h3 class="subsection" id='magicparlabel-1069'><span class="subsection_label">7.3</span> Editing in the Print View – WYSIWYG<a id='magicparlabel-1073' />
</h3>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1074'>Once you have finished entering music into Denemo you may find that you have a wrong note or two or a missed marking or slur when looking over the finished score in the Print View. It is convenient to shift-click (or click twice) on the notehead, marking etc. to position the Denemo Cursor on the object. For this to work look for the &ldquo;hand&rdquo; pointer as you move the mouse over the typeset score. The hand pointer indicates a place where if you click the Denemo Cursor will move to the Denemo Object that belongs to that feature. </div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1075'>Once you have located the note you wish to edit you can press the keyboard shortcut (or play the MIDI key or any other editing method) to change the note – to add a staccato marking for example. The Print View will not instantly update, but you can continue editing while it does so. If the Print View is not up-to-date the shift-click may not locate the correct note as your edit may have displaced things; to minimize this it is best to correct faults on a page from the bottom upwards. You are given a warning noise when the print view is not up to date, and a big warning noise if the locating has completely failed.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1076'>The navigation using shift-click in the Print View works for noteheads, slurs<a id='magicparlabel-1080' />
, ties<a id='magicparlabel-1084' />
 and various marks – some other things such as lyrics can't be used to navigate – choose the note that the lyrics underlie to find the right place in the Denemo Display.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1085'>You can actually edit your input music using the mouse on the Print View window – something referred to as what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG), which is how the conventional music editors work all the time. But in doing this it will help if you keep in mind that the Denemo program does not know anything about what LilyPond has actually drawn in the Print View window – Denemo is just displaying the PDF file that LilyPond has created. The PDF file <em>does</em> contain links – the &ldquo;hand&rdquo; pointer – so it does &ldquo;know&rdquo; about where things are in the Denemo Display, but not the other way round. This means that to use wysiwyg features you have to tell Denemo more about what you are doing than you would expect.</div>
<h4 class="subsubsection" id='magicparlabel-1086'><span class="subsubsection_label">7.3.1</span> Editing Positions and Padding</h4>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1087'>Right clicking on some objects in this pane allows you to edit them.Use this for the occasions when LilyPond has positioned things badly. </div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1088'>The editing procedures depend on whether the object is attached to a note or appears between the notes in the Denemo Display. Depending on the object you can drag it to a better position or change whether it appears above or below the note its attached to. </div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1089'>You can also select an amount of padding to apply to some objects so that they keep their distance from other items in the score. Adjusting the padding is generally a better way of indicating that something is too close to something else, since other objects will move away from it as needed and if you later edit the score it will behave more intelligently.</div>
<h4 class="subsubsection" id='magicparlabel-1090'><span class="subsubsection_label">7.3.2</span> Re-shaping Slurs<a id='magicparlabel-1094' />
 and Ties<a id='magicparlabel-1098' />
</h4>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1099'>Slurs, ties and beaming<a id='magicparlabel-1103' />
 can also be altered here. When you right-click on a slur or tie the Denemo Cursor moves to the note where the slur starts and you are offered the chance to edit the shape of the curve. Choose a large zoom factor before you begin, and turn on the control points (red dots and crosses) as described <a href="#subsec_Mouse_Controls">Section 7.2</a>above. Then right click on the curve and choose Edit Shape. You have to click on the reference point first – this is on the center-line of the staff at the horizontal position of the notehead where the curve starts – this is marked with a red dot. Then you click and drag on the four &ldquo;control-points&rdquo; that define the shape of the curve. Once the shape looks good, right click in a blank area and click Apply. </div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1104'>With practice you can skip the use of the red dots and crosses as you can guess where they would be.</div>
<h4 class="subsubsection" id='magicparlabel-1105'><span class="subsubsection_label">7.3.3</span> Adding Line or Page Breaks.</h4>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1106'>Page or line breaks added by right-clicking on a note at a barline and choosing from the menu. This works because right-click positions the Denemo Cursor at the note and then the page or line break command is run just as if you were working directly in the Denemo Display.</div>
<h2 class="section" id='magicparlabel-1107'><span class="section_label">8</span> The LilyPond<a id='magicparlabel-1111' />
 View</h2>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1112'>In this view the music is shown in the form it is sent to the LilyPond music typesetter. The LilyPond typesetter uses a syntax that can be read and written by human hand (the word c'' represents the note middle C for example) so this editor allows editing and navigating the music. </div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1113'>The lines are all numbered, and the bars always start a new line, with every fifth bar numbered with a comment &ldquo;%n&rdquo;. Directly editable text appears in bold, and additional syntax can be inserted by right-clicking with the mouse. (Equivalent to choosing the &ldquo;Insert LilyPond&rdquo; menu item).</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1114'>The first sections are definitions of the music for each staff/voice.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1115'>The last section is the <em>score layout<a id='magicparlabel-1119' />
</em> which can be a custom one or a default layout (or if continuous typesetting is on, a temporary one). If you want to edit the score layout directly as text then you can click on the Score Layout button here and convert it to a custom layout.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1120'>There is also a pane that shows any error messages that LilyPond may issue when typesetting your score. These are not not issued when a typeset is tried by the continuous typesetting mechanism, as you may be in the middle of an edit which might make the score un-typesettable (e.g. start beam with not end beam). Right-click and choose Typeset this LilyPond Text to force a typeset in this circumstance. Then when an error occurs the remainder of the text is marked in red. Using the arrow keys to move around this text, the Denemo cursor in the Denemo Display will follow, using the little gray anchors that appear before each note, rest, chord or other music object.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1134'>In the Playback View the MIDI is generated by LilyPond and has many more features than the simple MIDI generated by Denemo. This playback can still be controlled by the same commands in the Playback menu or the Playback Controls Panel and left-clicking on a notehead in the Print View, but in addition you can start play from any point in the music just by left-clicking on a note in the Playback View. Furthermore, in the Playback View, to play a section of the music click and drag to the end note desired. For a looping play hold the shift key while dragging.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1141'>For more sophisticated control you can set <em>scroll points </em>on the movement. This is what <em>right </em>clicking does in the Playback view – when you <em>right </em>click on a note head or rest Denemo will ensure that the page has scrolled while playing so that notehead has arrived at where it was when you clicked. With the music in the right place on the page for it to start, <em>right </em>click on the first note of the second system (so that the scrolling does not start until after you have heard the first system play) and then scroll the page up (using the mouse scroll wheel or the scroll bars) and click on the first note of the last system once the page is in the position desired for end-of-play. You hear a sound effect when the scroll point has been added to the list of scroll points for this movement and the place is marked with a green blob.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1142'>If there are tempo changes, scroll the page to the desired position prior to the tempo change and click on the last note/rest before the tempo change. (Instead of clicking you can drag notes to the position you wish them to be in instead – it's the same thing). If you add a scroll point wrongly, just click it again to remove it.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1143'>You may also need to set intermediate scroll points if the music has passages with a flurry of notes – just position the music for such passages and <em>right </em>click as with tempo changes.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1144'>Note that if you set scroll points on a movement these are remembered when you switch movements, and scroll points <em>are </em>saved with your score. This means that once you have set up your score for practicing playing your part, Denemo will remember how you like it to scroll. Note also that you can do minor edits without unduly perturbing the scrolling that you set.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1180'>The Object Inspector is shown by clicking View-&gt;Object Inspector, or just double-clicking on an object in the Denemo Display. It gives comprehensive information about the object at the cursor. This includes directives like ornaments, dynamic markings, fingerings that may be attached to the object. For objects like notes and rests which start at a particular musical moment it also describes at what moment in the measure the note begins and what its duration is.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1181'>The Object Inspector is sensitive to which note of a chord the cursor is on, so that things like fingerings (which can vary from note to note within a chord) are displayed individually as you move the cursor up and down a chord. You can step through the notes of a chord using the button marked &ldquo;Inspect the next note in chord&rdquo; which will work upwards through the distinct notes before wrapping round to start at the lowest note.

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1205'>As with the Object Inspector the Object Editor is sensitive to the cursor height, with the same navigation control (&ldquo;Next note in chord<a id='magicparlabel-1209' />

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1239'>The &ldquo;Next-&gt;&rdquo; button allows you to search on from the cursor for further occurrences of the Denemo Directive – other fingerings for button on the Fingering directive, for example.

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1240'>The &ldquo;Conditional&rdquo; button allows you to say if you want the directive to be ignored for certain <em>score layouts</em> <a href="#sec_The_Score_Layouts">14.2</a>.

You specify inclusion criteria to mean the directive should only be typeset when that criterion is set in the Print View. Or you can designate certain score layouts (e.&thinsp;g. typesetting just one part, or one movement) as ones for which this directive is active or ones which ignore the directive. So if the full score is wanted without fingerings then by clicking this button with the full score as the currently typeset layout the fingering directive can be designated as ignored by that layout.

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1246'>The Object Editor also has buttons for creating Palette Buttons for the Denemo Directive that it edits.

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1248'>This creates a palette button to run the command that created the Denemo Directive you have Object Editor open on. You are asked which palette you want to place the button in, and can create a new, custom, palette at that stage.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1249'>For example, if you use this on the Arranger attribute of a score you will get a button that runs the command Arranger (which is found in Score-&gt;Titles&hellip;). That button would then ask you to fill in the name of the arranger. Compare this with the next button, where you will create a button that will install a clone of Arranger attribute that you have on this score – the arranger will be already filled in, saving you having to enter your own name each time you create a new score.</div>
<h4 class="subsubsection_" id='magicparlabel-1250'>Create Button for Clone</h4>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1251'>This creates a button which when clicked will insert a duplicate of the Denemo Directive that the Object Editor is looking at.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1252'>This means that for any specific attribute you want to re-use you can create a button that will install exactly that Denemo Directive at the cursor. So, even if you do not know how a particular effect was generated, you can create a palette button to use the effect in your own score. The Open-&gt;Open Example scores provide useful examples of things you may need. See the section on Palettes<a href="#sec_Palettes">4</a> for more about palettes.</div>

The purpose of this is to have two versions of some setting (e.&thinsp;g. the indent for the first staff) which are used for different score layouts – a full score may require a larger indent than an individual part. If you make the duplicate conditional<a id='magicparlabel-1276' />

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1333'>It is common to want to create more than one edition from a single score. The simplest case is Score + set of parts, but you may also wish to have a version of your score transposed for a different instrument, or one containing fingerings for beginners, etc. For this purpose you can make the properties you set on the Score, Movements, Staffs, Notes etc <em>conditional. </em>The easiest way of creating conditional values is by invoking the command &ldquo;Conditional Values/Properties&rdquo; from the Score, Movement or Staff/Voices menus once you have created a default value for a property. This command creates conditional versions of the Denemo Directives that dictate the property. For Denemo Directives attached to objects in the music there are menu items to set them conditional. There are two sorts of things a Denemo Directive can be set conditional on, <em>Layouts</em>, and <em>Inclusion Criteria</em>. </div>
<h3 class="subsection" id='magicparlabel-1334'><span class="subsection_label">14.1</span> Inclusion Criteria<a id='magicparlabel-1338' />
<a id="sec_Inclusion_Criteria" />
</h3>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1339'>Inclusion Criteria are like flags that you set up or take down in the Print View. So, for example, if you want to generate score and parts for both a transposed and an un-transposed version of your score you can create an inclusion criterion with a name of your choice (say, &ldquo;transposed&rdquo;) and set it on the Denemo Directive(s) that control the transposition of the score. The easiest way to do this is first to create the default c-&gt;c transposition using the Transpose on Print command and then invoke &ldquo;Conditional Values/Properties&rdquo; from the Score Menu to create a different value for when &ldquo;transposed&rdquo; is set in the Print View.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1340'>Then you only have to turn the inclusion criterion on or off in the Print View and the typesetting switches between versions. If the instrument names should change as well then you can use &ldquo;Conditional Values/Properties&rdquo; from the Staff Menu to create an instrument name to be used when the &ldquo;transposed&rdquo; flag is set.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1341'>You can create an inclusion criterion in the Print View<a href="#sec_The_Print_View">7</a>using the button labelled &ldquo;No Inclusion Criterion Set&rdquo; or just create it on the fly when you make a directive conditional using the Conditional Directive commands. </div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1342'>For score, movement, staff etc directives you can use the command &ldquo;Conditional Values/Properties&rdquo; which lets you make some property you have set have a conditional value in addition to its normal value. </div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1343'>For more advaced use you can use Conditional button on the Directive in the respective editor (Score Editor, Movement Editor, Staff Editor etc). For objects (notes, chords, clefs, time signatures, key signatures, standalone Denemo Directives) there is a Conditional button in the Object Editor, or the Make Object Directive Conditional command in the Edit-&gt;Object at Cursor menu.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1344'><div class='Shadowbox'><div class="plain_layout" id='magicparlabel-1348'>Note that if you destroy an Inclusion Criterion then any Denemo Directive that required it becomes effectively unconditional - it will always be active unless you delete it or make it conditional on a layout.</div>

 Window<a id="sec_The_Score_Layouts" />
</h3>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1355'>Score Layouts are ways of typesetting a score for different purposes. Even without ever looking at the score layouts window you may find that you have been using them all along. For example, if you print just one part from a chamber work, or the vocal part from a song with piano accompaniment a score layout is created for this. In fact, layouts are always created when you typeset music – for example from the Print Window Typeset, Part or Movement buttons, or from the Print menu. These are <em>default score layouts </em>they are created automatically, and you don't have to think about them. They are useful for making things like page breaks apply only to the part or only to the full score etc - see making Directives conditional<a id='magicparlabel-1359' />
.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1360'>You can also create a layout using the Print-&gt;Select Staffs to Print menu item - by un-checking the &ldquo;Do not Create Layout for this selection&rdquo; check box you can create a custom layout that will print just the staffs(voices) that you leave checked. In addition other commands in the Print menu generate custom score layouts – for example a layout for the accompanist to play from, with the solo part printed on a smaller staff.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1361'>For more extensive facilities in choosing how to lay out the elements of your score when typeset you can open the Score Layouts window.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1364'>You can create custom layouts to print the music in different ways. For example, one layout may have the score transposed, or be for just two parts printed together. You start from a default layout, setting the values you want, and then click the Customize button.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1365'>You can customize any layout in this window – positioning lyrics above the staff rather than below for example, or setting the staff groupings. You can add any staff to any movement in the layout using the &ldquo;Append Current Staff&rdquo; button (place the cursor in the staff you wish to append). The buttons marked X next to the staffs delete. You can also append whole movements and re-arrange the order of the movements using the additional buttons that appear once you have made the layout a customized layout.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1366'>As well as appending staffs you can substitute the music for any specific voice<a id='magicparlabel-1370' />
 by clicking on the &ldquo;Substitute&rdquo; button that appears when you expand the voice details.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1371'>Although all score layouts have access to the same music to arrange on the score the music can contain features that are exclusive to a one layout or exclude one layout, by making Denemo Directives conditional on the layout being typeset.

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1384'>This is arranged in tabs for the different aspects that you can set.</div>
<h3 class="subsection" id='magicparlabel-1385'><span class="subsection_label">15.1</span> The View Tab</h3>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1386'>The values set via the View menu are mostly <em>persistent </em>and so don't need to be set here, they can be set via the View menu. There is a setting in the miscellaneous tab for this persistence property.</div>
<h3 class="subsection" id='magicparlabel-1387'><span class="subsection_label">15.2</span> The Command Tab<a id="subsec_The_Command_Tab" />

</div>



<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1390'>Here are options for how commands should be treated. The can apply to the note at the cursor or the whole selection. A note entered that does not fit in the bar can be split or not. Shortcuts can be set just by highlighting the command and pressing the key, or not. Menu navigation with arrow keys can be allowed (otherwise you would be setting the arrow keys as shortcuts). The Return key can be moved easily from command to command as a shortcut, or not. The &ldquo;newbie&rdquo; mode can be turned on – useful if you start to use a section of the program that is new to you. A window can be popped up to tell you which keypress you invoked. And finally the timing of the tooltips as you hover and move from one menu to another can be controlled.</div>
<h3 class="subsection" id='magicparlabel-1391'><span class="subsection_label">15.3</span> The Externals Tab</h3>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1392'><img style='width:80%;' src='images/ExternalsPref.png' alt='image: images/ExternalsPref.png' />
</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1393'>Here you can set the paths to external programs that you can use from Denemo. Binary packages have these set already, but if you wish to use a particular version of LilyPond or some other program to browse the manual then you will need to enter the name (preferably the full path) of the program concerned.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1394'>You can also set the default location for saving your scores. The update command set feature is not available at present.</div>
<h3 class="subsection" id='magicparlabel-1395'><span class="subsection_label">15.4</span> The Auto-Typeset Tab</h3>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1396'><img src='images/CommandTab.png' alt='image: images/CommandTab.png' />
</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1397'>This tab controls the continuous typesetting feature of the Print View<a href="#sec_The_Print_View">7</a>. Most of these can be set via the Continuous/Manual button in the Print View window, but here you can control how quickly Denemo checks for the need for a new typeset.</div>
<h3 class="subsection" id='magicparlabel-1398'><span class="subsection_label">15.5</span> The Miscellaneous Tab</h3>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1399'><img style='width:80%;' src='images/MiscellaneousPref.png' alt='image: images/MiscellaneousPref.png' />
</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1400'>The font used by Denemo for menus and dialogs tooltips etc can be set here: the default is a special font that makes it easy to read the musical signs – most fonts create 1/2 and 1/4 notes that are not easy to distinguish at a glance, the ones in the Denemo font are cartoon-like exagerations that make it easy to see what is meant. You can set the font size too – none of this affects the typeset score, naturally. Some menus that can become very large can be limited (a &ldquo;more&rdquo; button appears).</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1401'>The display animation controls are here – how quickly the display refreshes and how page turns are done in the Page View<a href="#subsec_The_Page_View">3.1.1</a>.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1402'>The excerpt resolution setting is to control the quality of the image created by the Print Excerpt command (printing little bits of music for inclusion in documents).</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1403'>Denemo can create thumbnails from the actual typeset music (done on closing the session or by a command) – these are displayed by file browsers (not on windows o/s though).</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1404'>Denemo keeps a list of scores you have visited recently – how many is controlled here. Use Open-&gt;Open Recent to choose one from the main menu.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1405'>The user name is set for visiting the denemo chat room via the Help menu.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1406'>The Autosave options guard against a power failure while you are working – nowadays you can set the time very short without noticeably impacting your work.</div>

</h3>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1412'><img style='width:80%;' src='images/AudioPref.png' alt='image: images/AudioPref.png' />
</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1413'>This tab affects the sounds you will hear via a connected audio system. The first section is for feedback when entering music. If you are looking at a source manuscript while entering rhythms or notes you will not want to look across at the input display to check that you are still entering at the right part of the bar. The sound effect that tells you a new bar is beginning is set via the first field – it is one of the drum effects available in the default Denemo soundfont, number 72, change this to 0 to turn it off, or other values for a more discrete sound.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1414'>There are settings for controlling the pitch spelling<a id='magicparlabel-1418' />
 for MIDI in – augmented and diminished intervals switch to this channel; if you hear this on an interval that was not supposed to be augmented or diminished you are alerted that you have the enharmonic range wrongly set for the piece. You can turn this effect off with the check box (The picture is out of date in this respect).</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1419'>The Dynamic Compression affects the volume at which notes are played back as you enter them from a MIDI keyboard – by compressing 100% you avoid meaningless variations in volume – you are only entering notes, not giving a moving performance, after all! Without this you will find some notes are too quiet to be noticed and will think the note wasn't registered. Note that the value 99 for dynamic compression is a &ldquo;magic&rdquo; value, it gives a slight after-touch effect, useful for percussive instruments (disatrous for organs!) to avoid the clipped sound when the note terminates.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1420'>The Audio Backend section changes where Denemo tries to send the output sounds to – it can be difficult to match up the options to the hardware (and o/s) settings you have. After checking carefully that you have got speakers attached and that they are working (e.&thinsp;g. by running some other program) you should turn off all other programs that may be hogging the audio out and then start up Denemo and only resort to changing the settings here if you don't hear anything. Be especially careful not to alter the Sample Rate and Period Size unless you are an audio expert.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1421'>The Maximum Recording Time is there to limit the amount of memory you gobble up if you turn on the Record<a href="#subsec_Playback_Controls">3.4</a> of the audio out. </div>

</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1428'>Here are the controls for a connected MIDI controller<a id='magicparlabel-1432' />
 (usually a keyboard nowadays). With Rhythm Entry checked you can type in unpitched rhythms and immediately fill them in from the MIDI keyboard<a href="#subsec_Playing_Notes_into">20.2</a>. The MIDI backend section lets you specify the controller you are using – set this even if &ldquo;default&rdquo; works. The MIDI output device is currently not used in Denemo.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1433'>The soundfont is the set of sounds you hear – Denemo is shipped with a smallish soundfont, but if you want something special then you can browse to the .sf2 file using the Choose Soundfont button.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1434'>The Pitch Entry tab is for acoustic entry of notes – this is largely replaced by MIDI keyboard entry now that MIDI keyboards can be bought very cheaply.</div>
<h2 class="section" id='magicparlabel-1435'><span class="section_label">16</span> Score and Movement Button Bars</h2>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1436'>The View-&gt;Titles, Buttons etc checkbox makes two horizontal button bars visible (if they have buttons on them). What the buttons show are titles/composer etc for the score and for the current movement. The score button bar holds the movement indicator buttons for scores that have several movements – you can click on one of these to move quickly to a different movement. In addition other score-wide settings create buttons on the score titles bar and movement wide settings on the movement titles bar. The menu items that populate these are under Score-&gt;Titles etc., and Movement-&gt;Titles etc and other menus. </div>
<h2 class="section" id='magicparlabel-1437'><span class="section_label">17</span> Style, Layout, Titling<a id='magicparlabel-1441' />
</h2>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1442'>This section covers where to find commands for titles, page numbering, table of contents, critical commentary, page size and so on. The commands for stylistic directives are in the Score-&gt;Typesetter or Movements-&gt;Typesetter menus. Here you find commands to set the accidental style (when should accidentals be repeated?) and bar numbering styles, Rehearsal Mark style, page numbering conventions, the fonts to use for the various elements of the score.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1443'>In this directory there are commands to control the number of systems per page or bars per system – these would only be needed in exceptional circumstances. There are also commands to control how systems are laid out on the page, and on the last page (the Ragged * commands), and to control the margins.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1444'>Notehead style for the whole score is here (see the Notes/Rests-&gt;Notehead menu for individual notes) and a command for creating a custom barline<a id='magicparlabel-1448' />
 style which can then be used in the score. </div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1449'>The command to instruct the typesetter to transpose the entire score is here – two flavors, a quick text-based one or one that allows you to specify the transposition you require by setting the pitches of two notes (from and to pitches).</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1450'>Titles menus are found in the Score and Movements menus. There are two styles of titles, Book Titles and Simple Titles which shouldn't be mixed.</div>
<h3 class="subsection" id='magicparlabel-1451'><span class="subsection_label">17.1</span> Simple Titles</h3>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1452'>Simple titles allow you to place fields of text around the music. In this example the fields have been named &ldquo;xxx movement&rdquo; when they have been set from the movement titles otherwise they have been set in the score titles menu.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1453'><img src='images/SimpleTitles.png' alt='image: images/SimpleTitles.png' />
</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1454'>Each field can contain any text you need, with the Copyright field at the bottom of the first page, the Tagline field at the bottom of the last page and the Instrument field at the top of each page.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1455'>When you first set a title you just get a text box to write the title in. If you invoke the title again (e.&thinsp;g. click on it in the Print View) then you can extensively alter its appearance using the LilyPond markup language – buttons are provided so that you do not need to know the markup syntax. See the section <a href="#subsec_Multi_line_Text_and">19.9.2</a> for the interface provided.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1456'><div class='Shadowbox'><div class="plain_layout" id='magicparlabel-1460'>If you have several movements without titles and then set a title for the score, that title will be repeated for each movement until you set at least one title field on the movements.</div>

<div class="plain_layout" id='magicparlabel-1461'>When you preview the title with the preview button you see the title relative to the default settings for that title – in particular if that title is normally bold and you want to turn this off you will need to use \normal-text before the text to be un-boldened.</div>
</div></div>
<h3 class="subsection" id='magicparlabel-1462'><span class="subsection_label">17.2</span> Book Titles</h3>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1463'>With Book Titles you get a title page with a border and then each movement can have titles of its own. </div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1465'>The music that appears on the title page can be selected from anywhere in the score, or omitted.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1466'>The Score-&gt;Titles-&gt;Book Titles menu also includes table of contents and critical commentary control.</div>

<h4 class="subsubsection" id='magicparlabel-1474'><span class="subsubsection_label">18.0.1</span> Overview of Lyrics</h4>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1475'>Lyrics in Denemo are handled as verses of text, each verse made up of syllables. The screenshot shows a piece with three lyric verses.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1476'>For each verse a tab appears in the lyric pane at the bottom of the main window. The tab is a simple text editor – a new one appears each time you execute Add Lyric Verse (<span style='font-family:monospace;'>Ctrl-l, a</span>). The syllables are not attached to the notes, so you can edit the notes freely without affecting the lyrics.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1477'>Note that the lyrics for a staff are only shown when the cursor is in the staff concerned.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1478'><div class='Shadowbox'><div class="plain_layout" id='magicparlabel-1482'>This means that you will see the lyrics for the current staff disappear from the Display Window when you switch staffs, which can be disconcerting, but saves space in the display.</div>
</div></div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1483'>Lyrics are entered as a <em>syllables</em> separated by spaces or new lines (which have no other meaning). While typing or pasting the text in will be enough for simple pieces, special syntax can be included for more complex tasks; in particular space, hyphen (&ldquo;<span style='font-family:monospace;'>-</span>&rdquo;), underscore (&ldquo;<span style='font-family:monospace;'>_</span>&rdquo;), tilde (&ldquo;<span style='font-family:monospace;'>~</span>&rdquo;) all have a special meaning as explained below. For words with more than one syllable, a hyphen can be inserted by &ldquo;<span style='font-family:monospace;'> -- </span>&rdquo; (space hyphen hyphen space) or via the menu (Lyrics &gt; Divide Syllables with Hyphen). Extra spaces and new lines can be used freely without affecting how the syllables are placed under the notes. The full possible syntax is given in the LilyPond documentation, but the guidance below covers many needs. Denemo provides you with menu items for inserting the most useful extras such as stanza numbers, font selection and skips.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1484'><div class='Shadowbox'><div class="plain_layout" id='magicparlabel-1488'>Special syntax beginning with a backslash &ldquo;\&rdquo; should be on a line by itself or at the end of a line, so that Denemo knows not to display it under the notes of the display.</div>
</div></div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1489'>The Lyric pane shows only a few lines initially, but you can drag it upwards if you need to see more or use the scroll bars at the side.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1490'><div class='Shadowbox'><div class="plain_layout" id='magicparlabel-1494'>You may find it tricky to catch the &ldquo;sweet spot&rdquo; where the lyrics pane can be dragged open, sometimes dragging the red bar at the bottom of the Denemo Display upwards helps – it can be returned to the bottom afterwards.</div>
</div></div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1495'>You can switch to the lyrics pane from the notes with <span style='font-family:monospace;'>Ctrl-l, Ctrl-l</span>. The verse changes background color to show that keystrokes will now edit the lyrics. And you can switch back from editing the lyrics to editing the music with the <span style='font-family:monospace;'>Ctrl-l</span> (or <span style='font-family:monospace;'>Esc</span> or <span style='font-family:monospace;'>Tab</span> keys). You can change verses with <span style='font-family:monospace;'>Ctrl-PgUpl/PgDn </span>keys and change staffs with <span style='font-family:monospace;'>Ctrl-up/down,</span> and save with<span style='font-family:monospace;'> Ctrl-s</span>. </div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1496'>While editing the notes the command &ldquo;Edit Lyric at Cursor&rdquo; (<span style='font-family:monospace;'>Ctrl-l, Ctrl-l</span>) finds the place in the lyrics corresponding to the cursor position allowing you to immediately edit the syllable that underlies the current note. </div>
<h4 class="subsubsection" id='magicparlabel-1497'><span class="subsubsection_label">18.0.2</span> Special Syntax for Lyric Verses</h4>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1498'>This section explains the special syntax that the commands in the Lyrics menu insert into the verse to control which syllables fall under which notes and other special effects. When you have used the commands in the Lyrics menu once (to remind yourself) you can simply type the special syntax when you need it again, saving time messing with the mouse.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1499'>In this section we'll indicate the syntax inserted by putting it in &ldquo;&rdquo; – the double quotes not being part of the syntax.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1500'>Grouping several words under one note:</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1501'>Lyrics-&gt;DivideSyllables</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1502'><em>Inserts &ldquo;</em><span style='font-family:monospace;'> -- </span><em>&rdquo; into the Lyric pane, which typesets as a hyphen halfway between the syllables each aligned below adjacent notes.</em></div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1503'>Lyrics-&gt;Lyrics Tie</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1504'><em>Inserts a single underscore &ldquo;</em><span style='font-family:monospace;'>_</span><em>&rdquo; or &ldquo;</em><span style='font-family:monospace;'>~</span><em>&rdquo; tilde, which will typeset as space or lyric tie &ldquo;ˬ&rdquo;, respectively. </em></div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1505'>An alternative to the underscore is to enclose the words in double-quotes, e.&thinsp;g. "<span style='font-family:monospace;'>word1 word2 word3</span>", where the double quotes are literally typed in.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1506'>Extending a syllable over several notes (Melisma) can be indicated by placing a slur over the notes (a phrasing slur does not trigger melisma).</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1507'><div class='Shadowbox'><div class="plain_layout" id='magicparlabel-1511'>Beaming can also be used to indicate Melisma (e.&thinsp;g. in choral music). This can be done by turning off automatic beaming and manually beaming those notes that have a single syllable. However, the Denemo Display will not display the correct underlay of syllables and notes when doing this, instead refer to the Print View (use continuous typesetting).</div>
</div></div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1512'>Lyrics-&gt;Melismata-&gt;During Word, with Slur</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1513'><em>Inserts spaced double hyphen, &ldquo;</em><span style='font-family:monospace;'> -- </span><em>&rdquo;, into the Lyric pane, typesetting hyphen(s) if needed to the end of the slur </em></div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1514'>Lyrics-&gt;Melismata-&gt;Word End, with Slur</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1515'><em>Inserts spaced double underscore, &ldquo;</em><span style='font-family:monospace;'> __ </span><em>&rdquo;, into the Lyric pane, typesetting a lyric extender to the end of the slur.</em></div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1516'>Lyrics-&gt;Melismata-&gt; During Word, no Slur</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1517'><em>Inserts &ldquo;</em><span style='font-family:monospace;'> -- _ </span><em>&rdquo; into the Lyric pane, spreads the syllable over two notes inserting hyphen(s) if needed. </em></div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1518'>Lyrics-&gt;Melismata-&gt;Word End, no Slur</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1519'><em>Inserts &ldquo;</em><span style='font-family:monospace;'> __ _ </span><em>&rdquo; into the Lyric pane, which spreads the syllable over two notes typesetting a lyric extender.</em></div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1520'>Lyrics-&gt;Melismata-&gt;ExtendMelisma, </div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1521'><em>Inserts &ldquo;</em><span style='font-family:monospace;'> _ </span><em>&rdquo; into the Lyric pane, extending the Melisma by one note or group of notes. </em></div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1522'>Skip Syllables in Selection</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1523'><em>Inserts special syntax e.&thinsp;g. &ldquo;</em><span style='font-family:monospace;'>\repeat unfold 4 \skip 1</span><em>&rdquo; for skipping 4 notes. This is an alternative to typing in a series of pairs of double-quotes, one for each skipped note. Once the syntax is inserted in the verse, it may be easily edited, if you have changed the length of the introduction. </em></div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1524'>Notes Without Words, i.&thinsp;e. gaps in the text, may be produced with a spaced symbol (if one is required) or by a spaced underscore or a pair of double-quotes (“""”) for each wordless note. </div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1525'>LilyPond's markup syntax can be used in lyric verses as well – prefix with \markup. For example </div>

<pre class="verbatim" id='magicparlabel-1526'><p class="verbatim_item">\markup\box&nbsp;</p>
<p class="verbatim_item">"boxed&nbsp;words"&nbsp;</p>
</pre>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1528'>will surround the words with a box – as you see a new line (before the actual words to appear under the note) is needed for the Denemo Display to underlay correctly.</div>

<h3 class="subsection" id='magicparlabel-1531'><span class="subsection_label">19.1</span> Beaming<a id='magicparlabel-1535' />
<a id="subsec_Beaming" />
</h3>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1536'>Commands to control beaming are available for individual notes, whole passages of notes and entire scores. Mostly the default beaming will be what you want. An exception is the beaming in 3/4 time which can look like 6/8 when beamed in the traditional manner. Use Object Menu-&gt;Time Signature-&gt;Beam at Half Measure to alter the default.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1537'>Individual beam control commands are located in Notes/Rests-&gt;Beaming. The start/stop beam shortcuts are usually [ and ]. Other commands include providing partial breaks in the beaming and stopping beaming on a note.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1538'>Setting beaming for the whole score can be done using ObjectMenu-&gt;Score-&gt;Typesetter-&gt;Set Beaming Rules. Either the general rule can be given, or Beam Exceptions can be set from the selection. To use the latter, set up a measure or measures with the beaming manually set using the Individual beam controls and then select the passage and invoke Set Beaming Rules.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1539'>Setting beaming for a passage can be done with ObjectMenu-&gt;Time Signatures-&gt;Set Beaming Rule. In addition, at a time signature change a beaming rule can be set using ObjectMenu-&gt;Time Signatures-&gt;Time Signature with Beaming Rule.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1540'>After automatic beaming has been turned off use ObjectMenu-&gt;Directives-&gt;Typesetter-&gt;Start Beaming to insert a directive re-starting automatic beaming at the cursor. The Cadenza On/Off commands turn on/off automatic beaming (as well as the timing control).</div>
<h3 class="subsection" id='magicparlabel-1541'><span class="subsection_label">19.2</span> Barlines<a id='magicparlabel-1545' />
</h3>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1546'>The important thing to know about barlines in Denemo is that they are not just graphical marks on paper – e.&thinsp;g. you cannot put a repeat end barline followed by a repeat start barline and expect both to print – instead you must use a repeat-end-start barline. This is because you are telling Denemo about the music, not about how to draw it – the repeat-end-start barline is drawn completely differently if it occurs at the end of a line, for instance.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1547'>Another useful thing to understand is that the &ldquo;barlines&rdquo; that appear in the Denemo display are not really barlines at all, just a convenient breaking up of the music into &ldquo;chunks&rdquo;. Normally, of course, you will use one chunk per measure<a id='magicparlabel-1551' />
 so they <em>will</em> correspond with the typeset barlines.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1552'>There is a relationship between line/page breaks and barlines: you cannot have line/page breaks at any point in the music, there must be a barline there. However this can be a &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; barline, so that option is in the menu too.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1553'>One curious consequence of this is what happens if you contrive to input notes that are timed so that a note is always playing at every barline; normally you use tied notes for this, but if (by mistake) you leave one bar short in duration you can find that none of the following typeset bars start with a note, and the result is that the line cannot be broken – it extends off the right hand side of the page.</div>
<h3 class="subsection" id='magicparlabel-1554'><span class="subsection_label">19.3</span> Ties<a id='magicparlabel-1558' />
 and Slurs<a id='magicparlabel-1562' />
</h3>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1563'>&hellip; and phrasing slurs. It is important to distinguish ties from slurs since they often look the same in the typeset music, but in some circumstances they are typeset differently – so you may think the music looks ok, and later after some editing, it looks wrong – you have hit a situation where the typesetting distinguishes the two. To help with this Denemo shows distinguishes slurs with little green and red markers for the start/end, while the ties are heavier horizontal curves. If you import music from other notation programs they often confuse slurs and ties, so a command to fix these is in the Notes/Rests-&gt;Tied Notes menu. (In the unusual case of slurred notes of the same pitch – e.&thinsp;g. open string/stopped note on a violin – you would have to correct the error by hand).</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1564'>Also in this menu are commands to tie individual notes in chords, to control the direction (up/down) of ties and to adjust the shape of ties which can be very tricky to position nicely in tight situations. Ties at repeats, where the tie goes to/comes from &ldquo;nothing&rdquo;, are here too;they are called Laissez Vibrer and Repeat Tie. (Laissez Vibrer has two uses, of course, but it is the same symbol).</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1565'>The commands for slurs are in the Notes/Rests-&gt;Slurs menu. The most useful have the shortcuts 7,8,9 to slur from the current note to the next note, to extend the slur and to reduce it. There are also commands to turn on/off a slur start or slur end, and these are also in the right-click menu on the notes in the Denemo Display.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1566'>When entering rhythms with the numeric keypad the slurs can be added without breaking rhythm by using the control key with the rhythm. So, for example, Ctrl-3 enters a 1/8 duration slurring from the previous note, or extending the slur. And Control keypad 9 (Ctrl-KP_9) creates a slurred dotted rhythm (corresponding to keypad 9 which creates a dotted rhythm based on the last entered duration) and similarly Ctrl-KP_7,Ctrl-KP_7 for entering a slurred triplet based on the current duration.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1567'>Phrasing slurs are slurs over the top of ordinary slurs, used in Romantic music and later. The display just shows where they start and end, the typesetter allows only one level of nesting slurs as that is all that is used in music. More would require a non-printing voice carrying the extra layers of slurs.</div>
<h3 class="subsection" id='magicparlabel-1568'><span class="subsection_label">19.4</span> Triplets and Friends<a id='magicparlabel-1572' />
</h3>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1581'>Collectively called &ldquo;tuplets<a id='magicparlabel-1585' />
&rdquo; these are handled in Denemo by two markers, one beginning the tuplet which holds the timing change and the other a simple end tuplet marker. The Denemo Display only knows how to display tuplets that start and end in the same bar, but the typesetter is not restricted in that way. You can stop and re-start the tuplets at measure breaks so that the Denemo Display understands what you mean, and control the placement of tuplet numbering and tuplet brackets using the Tuplet Brackets and Tuplet Numbering commands in the same menu. The typeset can also cope with nested tuplets perfectly well, though the Denemo Display will be strange.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1586'>There are specific commands for the more common tuplets, and arbitrary tuplets can be started using the Arbitrary Tuplet command – you give the numbers to denote the fraction that the timing is changing by (e.&thinsp;g. triplets are 2/3 of the duration written so you give 2,3). If you wanted 7 notes in the time of 4 you would give 4, 7 so that the durations changed by 4/7, after seven 1/8-notes you would have the equivalent of 4 1/8-notes duration.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1593'><div class='Shadowbox'><div class="plain_layout" id='magicparlabel-1597'>Grace Notes present a peculiar problem to the LilyPond typesetter that Denemo uses. As they do not have any duration it gets into difficulties if there are other things (such as time signatures, double bars etc) going on at the same time. The problem arises when other parts are also sounding and they don't have the same grace notes. There is a command in Denemo to work around this by installing &ldquo;grace note hints&rdquo; – these are dummy non-printing grace notes in the other parts. This is done automatically by the Check Score routine, so normally you don't have to run it yourself, but it is in the Notes/Rests-&gt;Grace Notes menu. It is good to be aware of this however, as you will see these pale yellow rests that declare themselves to be grace notes in the input music display sometimes.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1610'>In some circumstances it is desirable to place dynamics in a separate <em>Dynamics Line (or Staff). </em>This is often the case for the dynamics centered between piano staffs; it ensure that hairpins align with each other and that other dynamic markings are placed consistently. It also allows for positioning of dynamics markings other than directly on notes – they can be placed at slightly later or earlier times. To do this notes of shorter duration are put in the dynamics staff and the dynamic markings are attached to them.

A Survey of the Input Methods</h2>
<h3 class="subsection" id='magicparlabel-1662'><span class="subsection_label">20.1</span> Introduction</h3>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1663'>Denemo allows you to enter notes via PC keyboard, MIDI keyboard, Virtual on-screen piano keyboard or microphone input.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1664'>With Denemo you can tailor Denemo to allow you to use your preferred method of entering notes via keyboard. You can set the keyboard shortcut for a command just by pressing the desired key while the menu item is selected. You can right click on the menu item and choose Open Command Center to set a two-key keyboard shortcut. </div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1665'>By default, Denemo offers several ways of entering music: typing at the keyboard, playing in via a MIDI keyboard (controller), playing in acoustically using a microphone or choosing items from the menu system. </div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1666'>Typing at the keyboard can be very fast, if you forget which keypress you need you can consult the menu system to find out. This method is good for touch typists.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1667'>For entering a lot of already written-out music, playing the music in via a MIDI keyboard can offer the fastest and most musical method. There are two ways of doing this: rhythm first and pitches first. The latter is new in version 2.6 and may well prove to be the best of all.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1668'>For composing one method is to set the MIDI-in control panel button to &ldquo;Listening to Pitches&rdquo; for trying out the melodic line you are tinkering with, and then pressing the Shift key to actually enter the pitches, releasing after so that further playing will be listening-only. This is good also for transcribing by ear from a audio track - you can listen to a phrase, reproduce it on your keyboard, enter the rhythms from the numeric keypad and then pessing Shift enter the pitches from the MIDI keyboard.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1669'>With all methods of note entry a measure start sound will be heard when your note entry has moved to a new measure, which means you do not have to look up to know that you have started a new measure as expected. This measure start sound can be set to 0 in the preferences if unwanted.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1671'>Denemo can take pitches directly from MIDI input<a id='magicparlabel-1675' />
. Select Input-&gt;Midi Input. The control panel allows you to choose the enharmonic range<a id='magicparlabel-1679' />
, the default centers around the initial key signature<a id='magicparlabel-1683' />
 (e.&thinsp;g. E-flat to G-sharp for C-major). If you enter a diminished or augmented interval the note will be played in a separate MIDI channel which can be used to alert you to pitch-spelling<a id='magicparlabel-1687' />
 mistakes (e.&thinsp;g. entering A-flat when G-sharp was meant, you will get a lot more augmented and dimished intervals if you have the enharmonic range set wrongly for your piece). </div>
<h4 class="subsubsection" id='magicparlabel-1688'><span class="subsubsection_label">20.2.1</span> Pitches-First Method</h4>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1689'>This is new in version 2.6. The basic idea is to play in the pitches using the MIDI keyboard and then use the duration keys to actually enter the notes into the score.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1690'>The Playback/Record-&gt;Recording menu gives the commands to start/pause recording pitches from your MIDI controller. First you position the Denemo cursor at the place where you want to enter the notes into the score. Then you invoke Record from MIDI-in (Off/On) to start recording, Alt-r. A click track is created at the top of the score to act as a MIDI track. It has no clef because the recorded notes are displayed on the staff as belonging to the clef of the staff you are intending to enter the notes into, the one that contains the Denemo cursor. </div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1691'>If you have several staffs in your score and the one you are playing in is too far below the MIDI track you can invoke the command &ldquo;Hide Other Staffs (Off/On)&rdquo; (Alt-h is the standard shortcut) which will temporarily hide the staffs you do not need to see. While you are recording the Denemo Display has a red cast to it to remind you that playing the MIDI keyboard will enter notes into the recording rather than into the score.</div>
<h5 class="paragraph" id='magicparlabel-1692'><span class="paragraph_label"></span> Playing in the pitches</h5>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1693'>Once you start playing on the MIDI keyboard headless notes are entered on the MIDI track staff with an indication of their start and end points on the blue line at the top of the display.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1694'>If you play a wrong note and you can delete it with Alt-Backspace and then continue playing the correct notes - it may help to make a mark on the source original that you are playing from at this stage by dragging a small line at the location where you have stopped if you think you may lose your place.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1695'>On the MIDI track one of the notes is the <em>currently marked MIDI note</em> - it is colored green and highlighted with a green circle. The <em>currently marked MIDI note</em> is the first one that will be entered into the score when you enter a duration. You can play the recording from this <em>currently marked MIDI note</em> with Alt-p. To alter which note is the <em>currently marked MIDI note</em> click on the note on the MIDI track which or use the Alt-Left/Right to move the marker. </div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1696'>When playing the pitches augmented and diminished intervals are played on the pitch-spelling channel, so that you can easily detect enharmonic errors (e.g. D-sharp for E-flat). You can turn this off via the Edit-&gt;Change Preferences-&gt;Audio tab, by making the pitch-spelling channel the same as the channel for the notes.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1697'>When playing in the pitches you do not have to keep strict time, but it helps in keeping the display of the pitches nicely placed over the bars. For this reason it helps to set the movement tempo in the playback controls to a tempo you can comfortably play the notes at - you can change it afterwards to the intended tempo of the movement.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1698'>If you leave a long gap between two notes (e.g. because of a long rest) the recorded track will not leave a big gap but resume directly after the last note - you can control the amount of rest time you want to allow in a recording via the Edit-&gt;Preferences-&gt;MIDI preference &ldquo;MIDI-in recording timeout&rdquo;. </div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1699'>As you record the pitches the staffs will have extra blank measures added so that the MIDI track can show the pitches in the tempo of the movement. There is no need to pause recording to go on to entering the rhythms - just start typing in the durations.</div>
<h5 class="paragraph" id='magicparlabel-1700'><span class="paragraph_label"></span> Playing in the durations</h5>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1701'>Pressing duration keys, including dotted rhythm, triplet and ties and slurred versions of those commands will insert the marked MIDI note into the score at the Denemo cursor and move the marked MIDI note forwards so you can continually enter the music mostly in music time and rhythm. Use the Ins key to enter the additional notes in a chord. You should enter any rests needed in between the notes via the usual shortcuts (Alt-0,1,2 ... ). Mostly you can enter the rhythm in music-time so that you hear the melody as you press the duration keys, but you can stop off at any moment to insert dynamics etc and resume entering durations without a problem. When you reach the end of the recorded notes a clash of cymbals sounds and the duration keys will revert to entering pure duations - by this time you will have reached the small red marker in the original source you are transcribing from (if you placed one as you finished playing the notes). While you are entering the rhythm the MIDI recording track re-synchronizes the marked MIDI note at every new bar you reach so that the recorded note that will be entered next in that bar is visible immediately above on the MIDI track.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1702'>If you make a mistake while entering a duration you can delete the last duration(s) you entered using the Backspace key - the <em>currently marked MIDI note </em>will back up and you can continue with the correct duration(s). Alternatively you can alter the duration using the usual Shift-n shortcut and continue. If you want to delete a note without backing up you can use the other deletion methods (Del,Del, or Ctrl-X etc) or move the <em>currently marked MIDI note </em>forward using Alt-Right or by clicking on the note that you want to be the marked MIDI note. </div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1703'><div class='Shadowbox'><div class="plain_layout" id='magicparlabel-1707'>The shortcuts for entering triplets crash the sounding of the notes together - you can use the TAB shortcut to avoid this if you wish, though that, of course, breaks up the rhythm of your keystrokes. Otherwise you can just visually check that the right notes have been entered in the triplet.</div>
</div></div>
<h5 class="paragraph" id='magicparlabel-1708'><span class="paragraph_label"></span> Mouse Operations</h5>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1709'>Right-clicking on the MIDI track pops up the menu of the commands available in the Playback-&gt;Recording menu.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1710'>Left clicking on a note on the MIDI track will make that note become the <em>currently marked MIDI note</em>. Other left click operations:</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1711'>You can alter the tempo of the MIDI recording by Ctrl-Left-Drag, moving to the right stretches the recording out, to the left compresses it. This is only needed if you want to play back the MIDI recording with your score, otherwise the recording will be automatically synchronized and stretched/compressed while entering the durations as you reach each new measure. A click sounds as this re-synchronization takes place - this provides a check that you have entered the correct rhythm to complete the measure. </div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1712'>To reposition the recorded MIDI track relative to the score you can Shift-Left-Drag: drag from the MIDI track down to the place in your score where you want the <em>currently marked MIDI note </em>to be synchronized to and release. The MIDI track will be shifted so that the marked MIDI note appears above the place chosen. With Ctrl-Shift-Click you can set a note on the MIDI track as the currently marked MIDI note and start the recorded MIDI playing from there - clicking again stops the play.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1713'>Finally Ctrl-Shift-Left click moves the <em>currently marked MIDI note </em>to the clicked note and start playing the MIDI recording from there.</div>
<h5 class="paragraph" id='magicparlabel-1714'><span class="paragraph_label"></span> Composers</h5>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1715'>For people who compose at the keyboard one possibility is to turn on recording (Alt-r) and then play around with musical ideas until you have found one you wish to transcribe. At this point you can &ldquo;rewind&rdquo; your recording (using Alt-Up arrow) by a specified interval from the end. The exact place to rewind to can be found by playing the recording from this point (use Alt-right to step through or Alt-p to play) and rewinding some more or stopping when you reach the right point. Once synchronized to this starting point you can proceeed to enter the durations as usual. Again Alt-Del, c will delete the unwanted blank measures at the end if you have created them.</div>
<h5 class="paragraph" id='magicparlabel-1716'><span class="paragraph_label"></span> When finished</h5>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1717'>The shortcut Alt-Del, Alt-Del deletes the current recording while Alt-Del, c deletes the recording, the MIDI click track and any trailing blank measures that may have been created if your recording tempo did not match the tempo of the movement.</div>
<h5 class="paragraph" id='magicparlabel-1718'><span class="paragraph_label"></span> Miscellaneous points</h5>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1719'>If you want to reset the marked MIDI note to the start of the recording you can use the Alt-Up shortcut and accept the default value given - this places the marked MIDI note at the start and synchronizes it to the current cursor position.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1720'>The pitches-first entry method can be used even by unskilled keyboard players. As long as you can pick out the notes one after the other there is no need to play the music strictly in time - you can just enter one bar, or a line, or a short passage and then immediately switch to entering the durations with the number keys not even looking at the MIDI track created. Once you have used up the pitches you can just continue playing in another passage and so on until the piece is done. As mentioned above, the display of the pitches over the measures they belong to will not be perfect, but it is not critical.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1721'>Another method, for skilled keyboard players, is to press Alt-r to start recording then Fn5 to start the click track playing and then play in the notes in time to the click track. Then the entered notes will appear in the bars they belong to and (if you are composing rather than transcribing) can give you an indication of the rhythm you need to enter to notate what you played.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1722'><div class='Shadowbox'><div class="plain_layout" id='magicparlabel-1726'>Note that recorded MIDI is not saved with the score - it is intended only as a temporary storage until you have entered the durations and the pitches become real notes.</div>
</div></div>
<h4 class="subsubsection" id='magicparlabel-1727'><span class="subsubsection_label">20.2.2</span> Rhythms-First Method</h4>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1728'>Until Version 2.6 this was the quickest and most musical method of transcribing music available from any music notation program.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1729'>In this method you enter the music firstly as pure rhythms using the pc-keyboard, ignoring the note names. The durations show as yellow/brown notes. Each duration makes a distinctive sound as you enter the durations. As you start each measure a sound is made so that you can keep your eyes on the score you are copying from, without needing to look up and check that you haven't miss-typed. If you are a reading musician you will find that you tap in the rhythm rhythmically which helps to keep your place in the piece you are entering. </div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1730'>Once you have entered the rhythms for one or more measures you can play the notes via MIDI – the cursor automatically goes to the start of the rhythms you have entered. As you play notes in via MIDI they give their pitches to the rhythm you have notated. By this means you can enter a piece of music in the time taken to play it twice – once to give the rhythm and once to give the pitches. If the piece modulates strongly you may need to shift the set of accidentals used to match the score, the pitch spelling facility will alert you to this. (If entering pitches via a mic you need to navigate to the start point, but this isn't needed for MIDI in).</div>
<h4 class="subsubsection" id='magicparlabel-1731'><span class="subsubsection_label">20.2.3</span> The Numeric Keypad<a id='magicparlabel-1735' />
</h4>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1736'>The set of keys for entering numerical data that appear on full-sized keyboards make a very useful tool for entering rhythms. Even if you use a laptop without such a numeric keypad it is worth the 5 or 6 dollars/euros/pounds that a separate USB keyboard costs nowadays – it can be blu-tacked to your MIDI controller for easy access.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1737'>The default key shortcuts for the numeric keypad are illustrated here:</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1738'><img src='images/NumericKeypad.jpg' alt='image: images/NumericKeypad.jpg' />

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1739'>Here I have actually stuck labels with the most used durations and over-drawn an indication of the others. (Keys 5 and 6 do the1/32 and 1/64th notes). The keypad 7 does triplets with a double press (so that it makes three presses for a triplet, e.&thinsp;g. Key 4, Key 7, Key 7 for a triplet of 1/16th notes). The dotted rhythm &ldquo;dottifies&rdquo; the current note whatever its duration is. Likewise the grace note key turns the current note into a grace note and the tie key turns tied status off/on for the current note. Keypad 8 fills the rest of the bar with the current note or rest, while Enter duplicates the current bar. The enharmonic shifts<a id='magicparlabel-1743' />
 can be pressed repeatedly to shift the set of accidentals to be used sharp-wise of flat-wise, subsequent notes played in will be taken from the new set, which is indicated on the status bar. The duration keys, triplet key and dottify key can all be used with the Control modifier to slur from the previous note.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1744'>With this arrangement you can play in the rhythm of a piece in musical time and then play once more with the MIDI keyboard to add the notes (chords require the Ins key for the pitches first method or the Alt key or foot pedal for the rhythms first method). Before you are practiced in this use of the numeric keypad, if you are using the rhythms-first method it is a good idea to do just a bar or two, or a line or two at a time, so as not to lose your place. Correspondingly, if you are using the pitches-first method start by just playing a phrase or two of the music at a time before switching to entering the durations. In both methods no operation is needed to switch from entering pitches to entering durations or vice versa.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1745'><div class='Shadowbox'><div class="plain_layout" id='magicparlabel-1749'>Some computers don't respect the numeric keypad's keys – confusing the Enter with the Return key for example, or treating Shift-2 as arrow-down. Try the numlock key to see if you can persuade it to take you seriously, or look into any key-mapping facility there may be with the machine. And, beware! a separate standalone numeric keypad might seem like a good idea but in fact they are a nuisance, besides being more expensive, as they have things like a 000 key which emits three keypresses at your peril!</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1751'>Under Input-&gt;MIDI are various "MIDI filters<a id='magicparlabel-1755' />
" that allow you to control how the MIDI input is used: with none active the behavior is as if you had entered the notes using the pc-keyboard, but with the following advantages </div>

<ul class="itemize" id='magicparlabel-1756'><li class="itemize_item">The octave, accidental and note name are all entered in one press of the MIDI key. The cursor automatically advances so you can continue to play in notes.</li>
<li class="itemize_item">The duration keys enter the yellow/brown duration-only notes, when you play a MIDI key the cursor automatically moves to the first of these.</li>
<li class="itemize_item">Holding down the <span style='font-family:monospace;'>Alt</span> key (or sustain pedal) lets you enter chords.</li>
<li class="itemize_item">Holding down the <span style='font-family:monospace;'>Ctrl</span> key lets you check the pitches of a piece already entered. The cursor only advances if the note played is the one at the cursor.</li>
<li class="itemize_item">Holding down the <span style='font-family:monospace;'>Shift</span> key lets you listen to the MIDI keyboard without affecting the score.</li>
<li class="itemize_item">The problem of entering the wrong enharmonic is largely avoided by Denemo's simple pitch-spelling strategy. The more extreme intervals are played in a separate MIDI channel so that if, for example you enter F - A-sharp it sounds quite distinct from F - B-flat.</li>

<h3 class="subsection" id='magicparlabel-1762'><span class="subsection_label">20.3</span> Using an On-screen Piano Keyboard</h3>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1763'>The Input menu offers you a Virtual Piano Keyboard. This behaves like an attached MIDI keyboard but you click with the mouse or tap on your touchscreen instead of pressing the keys. The PC keyboard continues to work while using the on-screen keyboard, so you can delete/alter add ornaments freely while using this &ldquo;keyboard&rdquo;. Chords can be entered with a left-click, and as with a real MIDI keyboard you can enter as much of the rhythm before adding pitches (see <a href="#subsec_Playing_Notes_into">20.2</a>).</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1764'>The default keyboard is eight octaves around middle C which is highlighted by the letter C engraved on its keyhead. The Virtual Keyboard window can be scrolled to access other parts of the keyboard and made as wide as needed.</div>

<h4 class="subsubsection" id='magicparlabel-1767'><span class="subsubsection_label">20.4.1</span> Note Entry</h4>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1768'>The default keyboard shortcuts appends a note when you type a number key <span style='font-family:monospace;'>0 to 6</span> with the pitch taken from the cursor height and inserts a note when pressing a letter key<span style='font-family:monospace;'> a</span> to <span style='font-family:monospace;'>g</span>. This provides one way of entering notes – move the cursor up or down to the note position and press a number key for the duration. If the note is to be out-of-key then the <span style='font-family:monospace;'>equal </span>or <span style='font-family:monospace;'>minus </span>key can be used to sharpen/double-sharpen/flatten/double-flatten the next note. This method of note entry is probably not the most efficient however: in the Input-&gt;PC Keyboard menu you can choose to make the number keys change the prevailing duration without entering a note. With that setting you can use the note names to append notes to the bar only pressing the number keys if the duration changes. The duration can be dotted/double dotted with the period key, and the octave adjusted with comma (for down) or apostrophe (for up).</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1769'>Mixed mouse and keyboard strategies are possible too. For example with one hand changing the prevailing duration via the keyboard the other can click on the Insert Note buttons in the Note Insertion palette.</div>
<h4 class="subsubsection" id='magicparlabel-1770'><span class="subsubsection_label">20.4.2</span> Chord Entry</h4>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1771'>The standard keybinding for entering a note in a chord is the <span style='font-family:monospace;'>Insert</span> key, <span style='font-family:monospace;'>Ctrl-Insert</span> or<span style='font-family:monospace;'> Del</span>,<span style='font-family:monospace;'>Del</span> deletes. The is inserted at the cursor height, use <span style='font-family:monospace;'>-</span> and <span style='font-family:monospace;'>+</span> to flatten/sharpen the note before you enter it (avoiding hearing both notes if you flatten/sharpen afterwards). There are also commands to enter a named note <span style='font-family:monospace;'>Alt-a</span>, <span style='font-family:monospace;'>Alt-b</span> &hellip; are the standard shortcuts for this. When a chord should have two notes on the same line or space<a id='magicparlabel-1775' />
 the same keypress can be used to enter it, however selecting which note to edit can be tricky. The easy way is to use the Object Inspector<a id='magicparlabel-1779' />
's &ldquo;Alternate note at cursor&rdquo; button to make the note you want accessible for editing.</div>
<h4 class="subsubsection" id='magicparlabel-1780'><span class="subsubsection_label">20.4.3</span> Editing Music</h4>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1781'>When not appending music, the letter keys change the note at the cursor to that named note. You need to use the <span style='font-family:monospace;'>shift</span> key to insert a new note. So <span style='font-family:monospace;'>Shift-a</span>,<span style='font-family:monospace;'>Shift-a</span> inserts the note A etc. Plain <span style='font-family:monospace;'>a</span> edits the note at the cursor to be an A. Likewise with the numeric keypad the <span style='font-family:monospace;'>Shift</span> key can be used to edit a note duration, while the plain number keys insert the duration of the note at the cursor. (If you do not have a numeric keypad, you have to use the number keys – best to plug in an additional USB keyboard with numeric keypad, they are very cheap nowadays).</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1782'>Rests are entered with <span style='font-family:monospace;'>Alt-0 Alt-1 &hellip;</span></div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1783'>Spacer rests (that is non-printing rests as seen in keyboard polyphony) have shortcuts too <span style='font-family:monospace;'>Mod4-0</span> etc, where <span style='font-family:monospace;'>Mod4</span> is the key with a flag on it. However, on Windows machines you will need to reclaim the <span style='font-family:monospace;'>Windows</span> Mod-4 key from Microsoft or re-define the shortcuts, e.&thinsp;g. to <span style='font-family:monospace;'>Shift-Alt-0</span> etc or <span style='font-family:monospace;'>Ctrl-Alt-0</span>.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1784'>The <span style='font-family:monospace;'>Caps Lock </span>can be a nuisance – you will sometimes have it turned on accidentally and wonder why keypress are not working.

<h3 class="subsection" id='magicparlabel-1785'><span class="subsection_label">20.5</span> Playing Notes into Denemo – Audio (Soundcard Mic Input)</h3>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1786'>Denemo can listen for, and detect the pitch of notes on the mic input of the computer; it doesn't attempt to guess the rhythm – such systems do not work well – but you will find that playing the notes in time will help you to play them in, as well as make playing them in a musical experience rather than a chore.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1787'>Playing the notes in can be much quicker than using the keyboard since the note octave and accidental are all given just by playing the note. If you are able to play a musical instrument then this will probably be much faster for you than typing note names, octave shifts and accidentals at the computer keyboard. Using the headphones-out of an electronic keyboard avoids "noises-off" interfering with the pitch detection. Many microphones and pickups benefit from some pre-amplification – it is worth getting the level right before you begin.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1788'>When you select the Input-&gt;Audio on the Main Menu the Pitch Recognition window pops up. While the mouse pointer is inside the score drawing area the score is sensitive to pitches heard via the microphone input. The background colour of the score changes to show that the notes will be entered into the score. </div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1789'>There are two ways of using the pitch entry – Overlay mode (default) and Insert mode. The button marked Insert causes notes to be entered into the current measure in the prevailing rhythm – the mode is set to Insert for this. The button marked Overlays overlays the notes already present with the pitches you sound. There is a third button, marked Tuning, which is a state-of-the art musical instrument tuner.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1790'>Music is entered into the measure which holds the cursor. If you are overlaying a rhythm already entered, then the first un-overlayed note in the measure is overlayed by the note detected. You can delete the overlay using the regular delete keys, or clear them altogether if you want to start over in a measure. If you are in Insert mode then the notes detected will be inserted at the cursor position.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1791'>Use the enharmonic shift to select whether Bb or A# should be entered when you enter the given pitch – you can usefully go as far as B# and Fb.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1792'>Use the transpose control to shift up or down by octaves.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1793'>Most of the other settings would require study of the Aubio documentation to understand, but the one marked threshold may be useful to make the detection less sensitive to ambient noises if using a microphone with an acoustic instrument.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1794'>The best set-up is to plug the headphones-out socket of an electronic keyboard into the mic input, and choose a piano setting on the electronic keyboard.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1795'>If you don't have any musical instrument that you can plug directly into the mic in, then you can use an acoustic instrument with a microphone, in which case move your microphone closer or further from your instrument to get reliable detection. Too close and you get double detections, too far and you get missed ones. To check for good detection open a piece of music, set Overlay mode and put the cursor in the first measure and play the piece in – the notes should all turn blue if you have perfect detection. It is worth while getting perfect detection – more than one or two miss-detects per piece of music and you may want to use the Insert rather than the Overlay method.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1796'>The Audio Input button introduces a special entry mode where the pitches you play in will overlay the rhythm, appearing as blue notes. You can delete any wrong pitches using the usual delete keys, without deleting the rhythm. In fact if you have an "interloper" (an extra spurious note) you can delete it and the other pitches will all move along to their correct places.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1797'>Another method of playing music in acoustically doesn't involve entering the rhythm separately. For this select Input-&gt;Audio and then choose Insert instead of Overlays on the Pitch Recognition Panel that pops up. With Insert the sounded notes are entered as in the prevailing rhythm. The same applies if you have MIDI – by choosing a rhythm (e.&thinsp;g. half-note, quarter-note, or a custom rhythm pattern) and playing in the pitches you can enter the music into a blank score.</div>

</h2>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1799'>If you have a PDF<a id='magicparlabel-1803' />
 of music you wish to transcribe with Denemo you can display it within Denemo and create links between the source material and your transcrition. This means that when you later review your work you can quickly locate which point in the original manuscript belongs to which point in your transcription. In the screenshot the Print View window is shown on the left with the facsimile on the right. The Print View is a Custom Layout showing the chords both as notation and as chord symbols (as well as the original figures). The blue marker shows the position of the link that was clicked on to open the facsimile at the right place. Note that the piece is also being typeset in a different key – that is just another aspect of this custom layout. Everything – including the chord symbols are automatically adjusted.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1805'>Select the File-&gt;Open menu and the item Open a Source for Transcribing. Select the PDF containing the music to be transcribed from. The PDF is opened in a Source View<a id='magicparlabel-1809' />
 window. Right-click in this window at the point that your transcription will start. This will create a link – a Denemo Directive Object – in your score at the Denemo cursor position, shown as arrow icon. If you later use a right-click on this Denemo Directive the source file will be re-opened with the blue highlight marker on that point in the score. (Depending on the position of the top of the page you may need to scroll the Source View window up or down to bring it into view).</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1810'>When you re-open the score to check or edit at some point you can click on a nearby link and the source file will be opened and the position highlighted once again. If you place a link as the very first item on the very first staff of a movement then the link will be automatically opened when the score is opened on that movement.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1811'><div class='Shadowbox' style='width: 80%; '><div class="plain_layout" id='magicparlabel-1815'>Note that when Denemo locates a position in the source PDF it always puts the start of the page that holds the location at the top of the window. Use the Previous/Next button to ensure you have the page start at the top before using it to insert links. Note also that the links refer to the page with the zoom value that obtains when you create the link. It will re-open with this same zoom factor. The link will continue to position itself as you zoom, but if you zoom out so far that the space outside the page becomes visible the links will not match until you zoom back.</div>
</div></div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1816'>You can also &ldquo;mask out&rdquo; areas of the source view that you don't want to see while you are transcribing. This is particularly useful if you are transcribing just one part on a multi-part system. You mask out the staffs up to the one you want to follow and the ones from after that up to the same part in the next system and so on. To do this you drag down over the material you want to exclude – it turns gray leaving the part you are interested in easy to see at a glance. You can remove any one of these grayed-out areas – or all of them – by clicking <em>inside</em> them whereon you get a menu of choices.</div>
<h2 class="section" id='magicparlabel-1817'><span class="section_label">22</span> Comparing Scores</h2>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1818'>In the File menu is a command that lets you compare two Denemo scores for differences. You are given a dialog to choose each Denemo score and then these are loaded into two tabs and Denemo then scans for differences. It first flags up any differences in the Score, Movement and Staff/Voice information and then starts going through the scores note-by-note. You can stop the checking at any particular note or other music object where there is a difference and the cursor is left on that note in each score.</div>
<h2 class="section" id='magicparlabel-1819'><span class="section_label">23</span> Creating an Index</h2>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1820'>In the File menu there is a sub-menu Indexing that allows you to create an index for all the Denemo scores you have in all the sub-directories starting from some chosen directory (&ldquo;folder&rdquo;). </div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1821'>With the Create Index command you choose the starting directory for the scores you want to index and Denemo then scans all the scores below that creating a new score that typesets as an index to your scores. For each score the composer, title, instrumentation and the music for the incipit of the piece is typeset, together with the Score Comment if there is one. This index can be further refined by the Sort and Filter commands in the same menu. </div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1822'>You can create your own selection of scores indexed using the Filter by Scheme Condition<a href="#sec_Writing_Scheme_Scripts">30</a>. For this you write a valid Scheme expression that is true for the files you want. You write this Scheme expression in the Scheme Script window (show this via the View menu). The expression can involve the symbols called composer, title, comment, filename and instruments. These are all strings except for &ldquo;instruments&rdquo; which is a list of strings [for example the Scheme condition (= 2 (length instruments)) will select all scores that have two staffs]. This filtering of an already created index is very quick as the files do not have to be found again, however the selection is limited to just those properties of the score.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1823'>With Create Conditional Index you can create more complex conditions to determine which scores should be included in the index, and in addition you can create a comment for the index entry based on the score's content. A convenience function DenemoIndexCommentDisplay is provided to set the comment you wish to include in the index entry for a given score. Here is an example which computes the durations of all the movements in the score and prints that as the comment:</div>

Generally, you will find it preferable to set the MIDI<a href="#subsec_Midi_In_Controls">3.5</a> input mode to &ldquo;Listening&rdquo; when composing - pressing the shift key and playing will switch to actually entering notes. This avoids the danger of writing over the already composed music when playing on the MIDI keyboard.</div>
<h3 class="subsection" id='magicparlabel-1871'><span class="subsection_label">27.2</span> Creating Sketches.</h3>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1872'>Denemo has a command to cut the selection as a &ldquo;sketch&rdquo;. What happens is that the selected music is saved to a special sort of movement, called a sketch. Sketch movements are not typeset nor played when playing the whole score and are clearly watermarked &ldquo;Sketch&rdquo; in the Display. This means you can put aside one version of a passage, try out a new one, scrub that and return to the sketch to copy and paste the passage back into your score.</div>
<h3 class="subsection" id='magicparlabel-1873'><span class="subsection_label">27.3</span> Melody Fragments</h3>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1874'>If you are creating music at the MIDI keyboard and have found a fragment that you would like to notate, Denemo allows you to invoke a command in the Playback-&gt;Recording menu to record your playing and attach it to the score as an audio recording. The audio recording is displayed above the top staff (the command will also create a click track<a id='magicparlabel-1878' />
 if you wish) starting at the timing of the note at the cursor. When you play the score this audio is played allowing you to notate the rhythm to match it and enter the notes without risking you forgetting the phrase that you had recorded.</div>
<h2 class="section" id='magicparlabel-1879'><span class="section_label">28</span> More Features</h2>
<h3 class="subsection" id='magicparlabel-1880'><span class="subsection_label">28.1</span> Transposition<a id='magicparlabel-1884' />
</h3>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1885'>Denemo has much better transposition facilities than the common music notation programs such as Sibelius, Finale and Musescore. If you have used those programs you are probably thinking &ldquo;I need to transpose this music&rdquo;, meaning you are going to change all the notes and chords you have entered along with the key signatures. You <b>can </b>do this in Denemo (see Physical Transposition<a href="#subsec_Physical_Transposition">28.1.1</a>) but usually it is far better just to say that you want score to be typeset in the new key. This takes care of everything in one go – even footnotes that refer to the pitches of notes in the music will transpose (unless you have entered them as fixed values). And your input music stays looking just as you entered it – essential if you have to look back and compare with a source for instance.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1886'>The commands to transpose a score are in the Score-&gt;Typesetter menu. &ldquo;Transpose on Print&rdquo; is a graphical user interface – you get presented with a new tab containing two notes – clicking the Transpose button will transpose so that the first pitch will be typeset as the second one. The initial values a C and E♭ (up a minor third) so by typing G this would become up a fifth. The first note could be changed as well, if you know that D should become F♯, for example, then you can make those the two notes.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1887'>The other command is quicker but more technical – (Print) Transposed lets you type in the names of the two notes. The technical bit is how you specify sharp and flat and which octave. To specify sharp the note is followed by &ldquo;is&rdquo;, for flat &ldquo;es&rdquo; (these are actually the Dutch names!). Octaves are indicated by ' for up and , for down, so for example c c,, would mean transpose two octaves down.</div>
<h4 class="subsubsection" id='magicparlabel-1888'><span class="subsubsection_label">28.1.1</span> Physical Transposition<a id="subsec_Physical_Transposition" />
</h4>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1889'>In the case where you have changed your mind and want the actual notes you have entered to be altered the commands to do this are in the Notes/Rests-&gt;Transpose menu. The most general of the commands are Arbitrary Transpose Down and Arbitrary Transpose Up. These allow you to describe the interval you want to transpose the music by e.&thinsp;g. m7 for a minor seventh, d5 for diminished 5th. Alternatively you can use two pitches to describe the interval as in the previous section. Note that these commands work on the note/chord at the cursor or the selection; any key signatures will need changing separately if needed.</div>
<h3 class="subsection" id='magicparlabel-1890'><span class="subsection_label">28.2</span> Search and &ldquo;Replace&rdquo;<a id='magicparlabel-1894' />
</h3>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1895'>There are two categories of search available in Denemo. The first is in Navigation-&gt;Seek menu and the other is in the Edit menu.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1896'>In Navigation-&gt;Seek is the command to find a selected rhythmic pattern (Ctrl-f, Ctrl-f) – that is to find a sequence of notes with the same rhythms as those of the selection. Once found the pattern can be edited, either manually or by executing a series of steps recorded in the Scheme window (see section <a href="#subsec_Recording_a_Denemo">29.2.1</a>). There is also a command to find to find a sequence of selected notes. In both these cases the search can be resumed by executing the command with no selection.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1897'>The second sort of search is in the Edit menu (and also available from the Object Editor). Ctrl-e,e starts a search for objects of the type that the cursor is on, while Ctrl-e, Ctrl-e offers all the types of object in the movement and allows you to select which to search for. Ctrl-e,r resumes the search. When found the object can be manually edited, deleted or modified using recorded commands as described above. The search order is column-wise, that is everything at the same musical moment is searched and then the next musical moment is searched from the top staff downwards. When the end of movement is reached you can wrap to the start of the movement or move to the next movement or wrap round to the first movement.</div>
<h3 class="subsection" id='magicparlabel-1898'><span class="subsection_label">28.3</span> Rapidly Marking Passages</h3>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1899'>Frequently passages in a score need marking in some way - they need to be played up an octave, or they have a continuous trill sign above them etc. This is called Spanning<a id='magicparlabel-1903' />
 and the indicators for where the passage starts or ends is frequently marked by a pair of Denemo Directives or other pair of objects. Examples are in the Directives-&gt;Markings-&gt;Spanning menu. Other examples are tuplets<a id='magicparlabel-1907' />
, and passages in a different clef. Where a lot of passages need to be marked like this there is command in the Edit-&gt;Select menu which allows you to select passages to be spanned by a particular pair of objects at a single key press. This command is labelled &ldquo;Span Selection with Pair of Objects&rdquo; and it works by copying the pair to be inserted around selected passages onto the clipboard when the command is first invoked and then subsequent invocations place the spanning objects before/after the passage you have selected. In this way you can work your way through a score selecting passages to be altered and applying the alteration at the touch of a key.</div>
<h3 class="subsection" id='magicparlabel-1908'><span class="subsection_label">28.4</span> Piano Staffs, Orchestral Scores etc</h3>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1909'>A piano staff can be added using the Staff-&gt;Add Staff menu (or by adding the Piano instrument from the Staff-&gt;Add Staff-&gt;Add Staff for Instrument command). In addition, piano staffs, and staff groups such as choir staff can be created using the Staff Groupings menu under the staff menu. You can set a piano staff within a staff group by setting successively the StartPiano and StartGroup contexts on a single staff, or more generally setting StartPiano, EndPiano on adjacent staffs within a staff group.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1915'>Use the Staffs/Voice<a id='magicparlabel-1919' />
s-&gt;Voices menu for placing more than one voice on a staff. You can set the initial voice number from this menu (voices 1 and 3 are stem up with slurs and ties etc adjusting to suit, voices 2 and 4 are stem down). Directives can be placed in the music to change voice, see Directives-&gt;Typesetter-&gt;Voices menu.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1920'>You will also need spacer rests for voices that are silent, and commands to displace rests vertically and horizontally (see Notes/Rests-&gt;Rest Insertion menu), and commands from the Voices menu under the Staffs/Voices and Directives-&gt;Typesetter menus.</div>
<h3 class="subsection" id='magicparlabel-1921'><span class="subsection_label">28.6</span> Entering Figured Bass<a id='magicparlabel-1925' />

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1926'>To enter figures choose Notes/Rests-&gt;Markings-&gt;Figured Bass. There are some shortcuts that enable all the work to be done with the numeric keypad. A brief summary is given by right clicking the option. The conventions are described in the LilyPond docs.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1927'>There is also a MIDI filter for entering figured bass in the Input-&gt;MIDI menu. With this you play the bass note at the cursor and then the notes that the figures are indicating; on releasing the bass note the figures are entered for that bass note. The footpedal allows a sequence of figures to be entered on one note and also to enter extenders.</div>
<h3 class="subsection" id='magicparlabel-1928'><span class="subsection_label">28.7</span> Fret Diagrams<a id='magicparlabel-1932' />
</h3>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1933'>Fret Diagrams can be placed on the score using the command Fret Diagram in the ObjectMenu-&gt;Directives-&gt;Markings menu In addition by assigning a Denemo staff to display as fret diagrams, chords can be entered in standard notation which will then be dislayed as fret diagrams. See ObjectMenu-&gt;StaffMenu-&gt;StaffPropertiesMenu-&gt;FretDiagrams for this.</div>

<h3 class="subsection" id='magicparlabel-1943'><span class="subsection_label">28.9</span> Entering Chord Symbols<a id='magicparlabel-1947' />
</h3>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1948'>There are two quite different ways to enter chord symbols (also known as Chord Names<a id='magicparlabel-1952' />
, Fake Chords). If the chord changes do not happen mid-way through notes then you can use Notes/Rests-&gt;Markings-&gt;Chord Symbols to attach chord symbols to the notes themselves. A brief summary is given by right clicking the option. The conventions are described in the LilyPond documentation.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1961'>An alternative is to set a staff to display not the chords in regular notation but the chord symbol that represents the chord. Create a staff and use Staff-&gt;Staff Properties-&gt;Chord Symbols. Then this case you enter actual chords which will be displayed as Chord Symbols. The duration of the chords will determine the positioning, enabling chord changes mid-note. The chord symbols can then be arranged above or below the melody or other representation of the piece using Staffs-&gt;Swap Staffs or creating a custom layout in the Score Layout window.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1962'>A palette is available<a href="#subsec_Insert_Chords">4.5</a> for inserting chords, with this palette selected the key sequence <span style='font-family:monospace;'>pm7&lt;Enter&gt;,</span> for instance, will insert/append a c, e-flat, g, b-flat chord if the cursor height is on a C, (or c-sharp, e, g-sharp, b if there is a pending sharp<a id='magicparlabel-1966' />

<h3 class="subsection" id='magicparlabel-1977'><span class="subsection_label">29.1</span> Adding and Editing Key/Mouse Shortcuts</h3>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1978'>Denemo allows you to choose which keys activate which commands (shortcuts). It also allows you to choose Mouse press/release gestures (in combination with keys such as <span style='font-family:monospace;'>Shift</span>, <span style='font-family:monospace;'>NumLock</span>, <span style='font-family:monospace;'>CapsLock</span> etc).</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1979'>See <a href="#subsec_The_Command_Center">Section 5</a> for setting shortcuts. The following quicker method can also be used for one-key shortcuts. To choose a shortcut for a menu item, select the item (it becomes highlighted) and press the key that you want to become the shortcut. If your choice of keyboard shortcut already belongs to another command, you are warned about this, and given the chance to change your mind or steal the shortcut. Also, you can choose whether to distinguish between keypresses with, say the <span style='font-family:monospace;'>NumLock</span> down and those without or to ignore it. If the <span style='font-family:monospace;'>NumLock</span> is set but no command for that key specifically requires it then the setting of <span style='font-family:monospace;'>NumLock</span> is ignored and the keypress is treated as if the <span style='font-family:monospace;'>NumLock</span> was off.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1980'>The menu item that activates the command shows the shortcuts that exist in bright blue lettering. PrsL-<span style='font-family:monospace;'>CapsLoc</span>, for example, is the Press action on the Left mouse key while the <span style='font-family:monospace;'>CapsLock</span> light is on. In the default command set this is linked to the BeginSlur command, so that together with the RlsL-<span style='font-family:monospace;'>CapsLoc</span> for the release of the left mouse button, you can "draw" slurs by using the mouse. Similarly, <span style='font-family:monospace;'>Shift</span> with left mouse button (MveL-<span style='font-family:monospace;'>Shift</span>) is set to allow you to drag notes up and down the staff. (This is using Command MoveNoteToCursor).</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1981'>For mouse shortcuts invoke the Command Center with the right click on the menu item. The Set Mouse Shortcut Dialog requires you to set which button and action you want to use and then to hold/lock the keyboard modifier while clicking on the big button. The setting you have chosen is shown, and you click ok to accept it. </div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1982'><div class='Shadowbox' style='width: 90%; '><div class="plain_layout" id='magicparlabel-1986'>Mouse Shortcuts are tricky to set – you are able to control what happens on mouse button press and release, which can be used to do things like drag notes up and down.

<h3 class="subsection" id='magicparlabel-1987'><span class="subsection_label">29.2</span> More Commands</h3>
<h4 class="subsubsection_" id='magicparlabel-1988'>Adding More Features </h4>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1989'>It is possible to add more commands to the set that Denemo ships with. Some of these are shipped with Denemo, but not added automatically so as to keep the menu sizes manageable. Generally, you right-click to find more menu items to add; once added you can set a keyboard/mouse shortcut and keep the command in your default setup. Scheme to be executed at startup can be placed in the denemo.scm file.</div>
<h5 class="paragraph" id='magicparlabel-1990'><span class="paragraph_label"></span> An example – quicker dynamics selection</h5>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1991'>It can be slow to choose dynamics (<span style='font-family:monospace;'>Ctrl-D</span>) because the list is quite long to move down (or move to the mouse). You can define a list of the dynamics you actually want to be readily available as for example: (define DenemoDynamicList '(("f" "127" "Forte") ("p" "127" "Piano"))) This makes forte available just by pressing Return and piano available by pressing down arrow Return. (The others via More of course). If you place this in (home directory)/.denemo-x.x.x/actions/denemo.scm then it will be defined when you start Denemo.</div>
<h4 class="subsubsection" id='magicparlabel-1992'><span class="subsubsection_label">29.2.1</span> Recording a Denemo Macro<a id="subsec_Recording_a_Denemo" />
 </h4>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1993'>You can record a frequently used sequence of actions into the Scheme window. These can be used in search and replace operations or they can be installed as a command in the menu system and given a keyboard shortcut or placed in a palette. </div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1994'>To do this choose View-&gt;Scheme Script. (You do not have to understand what a Scheme Script is to use this!) In the window that pops up check Record Scheme Script and then do the set of steps you wish Denemo to record. As you execute each command the Scheme window gets that command added to it.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1995'>For example, suppose you wanted to place a trill on a particular note in a certain rhythmic pattern that occurs frequently in a piece. You would record the cursor moves and the Trill command needed to edit the pattern concerned and then use the Search and &ldquo;Replace&rdquo; facility to seek the pattern you needed selecting &ldquo;Continue&rdquo; or &ldquo;Execute Scheme&rdquo; as each pattern is found.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1996'>Or, suppose you wanted a command to delete the next note (there are commands to delete the previous note and the current note, so why not?). You would enter some notes, put on Record Scheme Script and then move the cursor right two steps and delete the previous note (with Backspace if that is your shortcut). (Each time you use a command you will see the Scheme syntax for that command entered into the Scheme window). Now turn off Record Scheme Script and you can experiment with your new command by pressing Execute in the Scheme Script window. To save this new command for future use, you right click on a menu item (in the menu where you would like the command to appear) and choose "Save Script as New Menu Item", this will ask you to make up a name for your new command as well as a label for the menu item etc.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1997'>You can save the command in your default sequence of commands (via Edit-&gt;Customize Commands&hellip;-&gt;Manage Command Set-&gt;Save as Default Command Set). If not you will be asked if you want to save your new commands when you exit. Otherwise you can re-load via the More-&gt;My Commands menu item. </div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-1998'><div class='Shadowbox' style='width: 90%; '><div class="plain_layout" id='magicparlabel-2002'>Turn off the Record before starting the search and replace, otherwise the search and replace command itself will be recorded.

</div></div>
<h4 class="subsubsection" id='magicparlabel-2003'><span class="subsubsection_label">29.2.2</span> Editing a LilyPond<a id='magicparlabel-2007' />
 Tweak</h4>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-2008'>There is another way of adding your own favorite LilyPond tweaks, which is by modifying a tweak that has already been done. This can be done by using the text-edit dialog on an existing Denemo Directive (usually found under the Advanced button provided in the Object Editor<a href="#sec_Object_Editor">11</a>). Here you can see the actual LilyPond text that will be inserted, and there is a button to create a script to generate whatever you choose to enter. You can also enter the name of graphic images (.png files) that are to be used to represent your item in the display, and say where it should be positioned.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-2009'>Once you have created the script, it can be saved in the menu system by right clicking on an item in the menu where you want to place the command, and choosing "Save Script as New Menu Item" as above. An alternative to creating a command in the menu system is to create a palette button (see the Object Editor<a href="#sec_Object_Editor">11</a>).</div>

</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-2016'>If you are a programmer you will have guessed that you can edit the Scheme Script window to create any command you want. Even if you are not familiar with Scheme you may find that you can adapt other scripts to do what you want.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-2017'>A good example of this is a script to insert a particular LilyPond directive into the score. This is all that many scripts do: it is easy to see the piece of LilyPond in the Scheme Script window, and by changing it you can create a new command.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-2018'>For example, from the More menu select the command /menus/ObjectMenu/Instruments/Orchestral/RehearsalMark (the files are laid out in folders/directories in the same way as the menu system itself). Then choose Get Script into Scheme Window from the right click menu. With this command its script is appended to the Scheme Script window. Here you can see the part that says</div>



<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-2027'>which is inserting the LilyPond directive "\mark \default" which inserts the default rehearsal mark. (The extra backslashes are needed to tell Scheme that you literally mean a \ sign). You can change this to insert any other LilyPond that you need – always doubling the \ signs. Then you can save as a new menu item, a palette button, or use Save Script from Scheme Window to customize the command you started with.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-2028'>More ambitious programmers will need to know all the commands available. Besides the complete Denemo command set (the list is given in the Command Center window) there are the following additional Scheme procedures defined (see the files actions/denemo.scm and actions/denemo-modules/*.scm for more). A brief summary of any Scheme procedure can be obtained by typing its name into the Scheme Window in the command line interface (CLI) and pressing Enter. The help text attached to built-in commands is available in a Scheme variable constructed by prefixing the command name with &ldquo;Help-&rdquo;, however there are older, hardwired commands for which this doesn't work at present.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-2498'>The MIDI filters are scheme scripts, so they can be tailored to do whatever you wish. One example is a filter that enables you to enter Figured Bass figures by playing the notes corresponding to the figures while holding down the bass note. Another is the "AngryDelete" filter. With this filter on notes are entered normally with the cursor advancing automatically, but if you make a mistake and press the wrong note just hit the next one much louder and it will make the correction for you! MIDI filters are found under Input -&gt; MIDI.</div>
<h3 class="subsection" id='magicparlabel-2499'><span class="subsection_label">30.12</span> LilyPond Editing</h3>
<h5 class="paragraph" id='magicparlabel-2500'><span class="paragraph_label"></span> Introduction</h5>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-2501'>From version 0.7.8 we have the ability to edit the LilyPond output within Denemo. This approach immediately makes Denemo able to do many more things (e.&thinsp;g. multiple verses for songs) with the music still editable from within Denemo. The gallery of examples and the standard templates contain examples which you can use.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-2502'>These can be used without knowing the LilyPond language (provided a suitable template or example file exists). Alternatively, with a general idea of how a LilyPond file works tweaks from the LilyPond documentation can be inserted into the LilyPond output and stored with the Denemo, leaving open the possibility of further editing of the notes within Denemo without the need to re-apply tweaks or keep separate LilyPond files.</div>
<h4 class="subsubsection" id='magicparlabel-2503'><span class="subsubsection_label">30.12.1</span> Using the LilyPond Window</h4>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-2504'>Under the View menu is a Show LilyPond item which pops up a window with the LilyPond output in it. The text is interspersed with buttons which enable you to hide or show the various sections or to create custom versions. The text in bold can be altered and the alterations are kept in the Denemo file.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-2505'>The two windows are kept in sync, so you can move back and forth between editing textually and editing in Denemo.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-2506'>Right clicking on the text gives a menu for actions on the LilyPond text. LilyPond text can be inserted between notes, and the final section (the score layout) can be turned into editable text (see Score Layout). There is one for moving the cursor to the LilyPond text for the current Denemo object. Moving the cursor in the text window with the arrow keys causes the Denemo window cursor to move in synchronism.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-2507'>This menu also includes a Print command that operates on the visible LilyPond text in the window. This means you can open specific custom score layouts and print from them, or even make a temporary edit for just one print. If you save the score with custom layouts then these are remembered. So when you reload and the custom score layout will be printed.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-2508'>You can switch back from the LilyPond window to the Denemo Display by pressing Esc or Ctrl-w.</div>
<h5 class="paragraph" id='magicparlabel-2509'><span class="paragraph_label"></span> Detail</h5>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-2510'>Several custom layouts can be kept, selecting them in the Score Layout view enables the same Denemo file to print a variety of things from the same music input. </div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-2511'>For example, a full score or a set of parts, or several voices on group of staffs or even a piano reduction. </div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-2512'>The various Voices/Staffs for the different Movements are separated by buttons. These are labelled by enumerating the movements and staffs in order, so the first voice in the first movement has the music defined as "MvmntIVoiceIMusic" and so on. Within these music blocks you can insert arbitrary LilyPond text between notes, (the insertion points are marked by grey blocks) and the text inserted will appear as a LilyPond directives in the main Denemo window. </div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-2513'>The main Denemo window also moves its cursor to correspond with where you are editing. (It should of course move the cursor immediately you click on a point in the music, but, as yet, it only moves the cursor when you press a key just before the note name – one of the arrow keys will do).</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-2514'>Custom layout blocks can be created by right-clicking on the Standard score layout and selecting create custom score layout. The Score Layout window allows creation of customized layouts via a GUI. If you print a single part from all movements, you get the standard scoreblock for this and can add it to your custom score block so that a single print command prints, e.&thinsp;g. both a full score and parts. Using the \book {} block you can put these into separate files (stored in the folder .denemo in your home folder).</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-2515'>The music defined by MvmntIVoiceIMusic is then used in the score blocks at the end of the LilyPond window, by the expression \MvmntIVoiceIMusic. This means that the same music can be output in several different ways, so that the same Denemo file can contain custom score blocks to output the music as a Piano Score with several voices or separate parts, for example.</div>

Denemo Objects</h2>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-2542'>Denemo Objects are all the things that are placed in the measures of the staffs in the Denemo Display. These are Chords, Notes (single note chords), Rests, Clef Changes, Key Changes, Time Signature Changes, Voice Changes (stemming control), Tuplet Starts, Tuplet Ends and Denemo Directives. The Denemo cursor can be stepped through every Denemo Object in the bar and by double clicking the object can be inspected and edited in detail.</div>
<h2 class="section" id='magicparlabel-2543'><span class="section_label">32</span> <a id="sec_Denemo_Directives" />
Denemo Directives</h2>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-2544'>Denemo Directives give attributes to objects that are not built-in but can be changed by the user.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-2545'>Denemo Directives can be attached at almost every level of a Denemo score and can modify the behavior of the element concerned. They contain fields to describe how the element's properties should be modified, either in the display or in the printing. Elements, such as clefs notes etc have their own built-in display and print properties; Denemo Directives allow you (or scripts you invoke) to modify them for many more purposes than the built-in set allows. This means Denemo can grow – you can add features – without getting a new version.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-2546'>For example the drum clef is not built-in to Denemo. Instead a directive attached to the clef has a field (graphic) set to an image of the drum clef, and another field (postfix) set to the LilyPond syntax for a drum clef, while another field (override) is set to indicate that these values should replace the normal ones, rather than adding to them.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-2547'>The elements that can be modified in this way are the following:</div>

<ol class='lyxlist' id='magicparlabel-2548'><li class="labeling_item"><span class='lyxlist'>score:</span>
 the LilyPond fields (prefix and postfix) are placed at the start of the score and just before each movement. The display field is shown at the top of the display.</li>
<li class="labeling_item"><span class='lyxlist'>scoreheader:</span>
 Attached to the score. The postfix field is put inside a \header{} block at the start of the score.</li>
<li class="labeling_item"><span class='lyxlist'>movementcontrol:</span>
 Attached to a movement. The prefix field is placed before the movements \score{} block, the postfix after it.</li>
<li class="labeling_item"><span class='lyxlist'>header:</span>
 Attached to a movement. As scoreheader but for \header{} blocks inside the movement's score block.</li>
<li class="labeling_item"><span class='lyxlist'>paper:</span>
 Attached to the score. The postfix is placed inside a \paper{} block.</li>
<li class="labeling_item"><span class='lyxlist'>layout:</span>
 Attached to a movement. The postfix is placed inside a \layout{} block in the movement's scoreblock.</li>
<li class="labeling_item"><span class='lyxlist'>clef:</span>
 Attached to a clef or clef change. The graphic holds the displayed icon, gx,gy its position. The postfix field is put into the music at the point where the clef is found, replacing the normal text if the override is set.</li>
<li class="labeling_item"><span class='lyxlist'>timesig:</span>
 Attached to a time signature or time signature change. The graphic holds the displayed icon, gx,gy its position. The postfix field is put into the music at the point where the time signature is found, replacing the normal text if the override is set.</li>
<li class="labeling_item"><span class='lyxlist'>keysig:</span>
 as timesig but for key signatures. (e.&thinsp;g. used to supress keysignatures in drum clef).</li>
<li class="labeling_item"><span class='lyxlist'>staff:</span>
 The postfix field modifies the whole staff context, with the display field printed at the start of the staff</li>
<li class="labeling_item"><span class='lyxlist'>voice:</span>
 The postfix field modifies the voice context, with the display field printed at the start of the staff containing the voice</li>
<li class="labeling_item"><span class='lyxlist'>standalone:</span>
 A directive not attached to an music element – it comes with the music and is used for things like repeat bars etc.</li>
<li class="labeling_item"><span class='lyxlist'>chord:</span>
 The prefix field is emitted before the LilyPond for the chord and the postfix after it.</li>
<li class="labeling_item"><span class='lyxlist'>note:</span>
 The prefix field is emitted before the LilyPond for the note and the postfix after it. Examples are fingerings attached to notes etc. Again the display and graphic fields a placed in the display positioned relative to the note via the coordinate fields gx, gy (for the graphic) and tx, ty for the display text.</li>
</ol>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-2562'>The Directives are sufficiently important to have their own commands.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-2563'>d-DirectivePut-type-field where type is one of score, scoreheader, movementcontrol, header, paper, layout, clef, timesig, keysig, staff, voice, standalone, chord or note and field is one of display, tx, ty, gx, gy, graphic, prefix, postfix, override, midibytes. These commands take two arguments, a tag (string) and a value to set. For example:</div>



<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-2572'>will put the fingering 3 on (after) the note at the cursor.</div>

<ol class='lyxlist' id='magicparlabel-2573'><li class="labeling_item"><span class='lyxlist'>d-DirectiveGet-type-field</span>
 <em>type</em> is one of score, scoreheader, movementcontrol, header, paper, layout, clef, timesig, keysig, staff, voice, standalone, chord or note and field is one of display, tx, ty, gx, gy, graphic, prefix, postfix, override, midibytes. This function returns the value in the field or #f if there is no directive with the given tag at the cursor.</li>
<li class="labeling_item"><span class='lyxlist'>d-DirectiveDelete-type</span>
 <em>type</em> is one of score, scoreheader, movementcontrol, header, paper, layout, clef, timesig, keysig, staff, voice, standalone, chord or note. This function returns #t or #f if a directive with the given tag was deleted.</li>
<li class="labeling_item"><span class='lyxlist'>d-Directive-type?</span>
 returns true if a directive with passed tag is present at cursor, with no tag argument returns true if any such directive is present</li>
<li class="labeling_item"><span class='lyxlist'>d-DirectiveGetForTag-type</span>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-2579'>The fields of the Denemo Directive can control the Denemo Display and the LilyPond output.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-2580'>The fields in d-DirectiveGet/Put have the following meanings:</div>

<ol class='lyxlist' id='magicparlabel-2581'><li class="labeling_item"><span class='lyxlist'>postfix</span>
 – A fragment of LilyPond to be output (after the LilyPond for any object the directive is attached to). </li>
<li class="labeling_item"><span class='lyxlist'>prefix</span>
 – A fragment of LilyPond to be output (before the LilyPond for any object the directive is attached to). </li>
<li class="labeling_item"><span class='lyxlist'>display</span>
 – text to be shown in the Denemo Display</li>
<li class="labeling_item"><span class='lyxlist'>tx,ty</span>
 – where to show the text in the Denemo Display</li>
<li class="labeling_item"><span class='lyxlist'>graphic</span>
 – For directives that are in the music this is a .png image to be shown in the Denemo Display (the directory bitmaps holds these). The graphic can be saved for a command using the right-click -&gt; Save Graphic command, after selecting a portion of the print preview as the image required. For directives attached to the score, movement etc the string set here will be displayed on the button in the button box for that sort of directive (see Show Score Titles etc in view menu for showing this button box).</li>
<li class="labeling_item"><span class='lyxlist'>gx,gy</span>
 – where to show thegraphic in the Denemo Display</li>
<li class="labeling_item"><span class='lyxlist'>minpixels</span>
 – how much space to leave for this item in the Denemo Display</li>
<li class="labeling_item"><span class='lyxlist'>override</span>
 – Contains bits to determine whether the LilyPond contained in the Directive (postfix and/or prefix fields) should override the normal LilyPond output, and whether the Graphic should replace the normal Denemo display for the item. A further tranche of bits controls MIDI output for the directive, which can override the normal MIDI interpretation of the music and provide additional information not explicit in the music notation (e.&thinsp;g. the tempo of an Adagio marking).</li>
<li class="labeling_item"><span class='lyxlist'>midibytes</span>
 – a string of numbers (in hexadecimal format) whose interpretation is given by the MIDI bits in the override field</li>
</ol>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-2590'>The override field contains the following bits:</div>

<ol class='lyxlist' id='magicparlabel-2591'><li class="labeling_item"><span class='lyxlist'>DENEMO_OVERRIDE_LILYPOND:</span>
 override the LilyPond output normally used at this point, rather than adding to the normal output. The text used is in the prefix and postfix fields.</li>
<li class="labeling_item"><span class='lyxlist'>DENEMO_OVERRIDE_GRAPHIC:</span>
 overrides what Denemo would normally show in the display with the image named in the graphic field of the directive</li>
</ol>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-2593'>The MIDI bits in the override field are as follows</div>

<ol class='lyxlist' id='magicparlabel-2594'><li class="labeling_item"><span class='lyxlist'>DENEMO_OVERRIDE_VOLUME:</span>
 the MIDI velocity to use</li>
<li class="labeling_item"><span class='lyxlist'>DENEMO_OVERRIDE_DURATION:</span>
 affects the duration of a note. not yet implemented</li>
<li class="labeling_item"><span class='lyxlist'>DENEMO_OVERRIDE_REPEAT:</span>
 indicates that an earlier passage should be repeated (from a directive of the same tag). not yet implemented</li>
<li class="labeling_item"><span class='lyxlist'>DENEMO_OVERRIDE_CHANNEL:</span>
 midibytes field gives the MIDI channel to use (? implemented?)</li>
<li class="labeling_item"><span class='lyxlist'>DENEMO_OVERRIDE_TEMPO:</span>
 midibytes field gives the tempo to use.</li>
</ol>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-2599'>The interpretation of these flags is modified by the following flags:</div>

<ol class='lyxlist' id='magicparlabel-2600'><li class="labeling_item"><span class='lyxlist'>DENEMO_OVERRIDE_ONCE:</span>
 the value in midibytes is to be used just for the item the directive is attached to. not yet implemented</li>
<li class="labeling_item"><span class='lyxlist'>DENEMO_OVERRIDE_STEP:</span>
 the value in midibytes is to be used from this point on</li>
<li class="labeling_item"><span class='lyxlist'>DENEMO_OVERRIDE_RAMP:</span>
 the value in midibytes is to be used as a starting value, a corresponding directive (i.&thinsp;e. with the same tag) gives the findal value, values are then interpolated between these. not yet implemented</li>
<li class="labeling_item"><span class='lyxlist'>DENEMO_OVERRIDE_RELATIVE:</span>
 value in midibytes is used relative to the current value (otherwise it is an absolute value; e.&thinsp;g. an absolute velocity etc)</li>
<li class="labeling_item"><span class='lyxlist'>DENEMO_OVERRIDE_PERCENT:</span>
 value in midibytes is interpreted as percentage value. not yet implemented</li>
</ol>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-2605'>These flags are combined together to get the combination required for the directive using the scheme procedure called logior.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-2606'>Here is an example, making a step-change in volume of 0x40 in the MIDI output, and printing "più mosso" in the output score </div>



<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-2622'>In this example the directive is a standalone directive. MIDI commands are being extended to apply to chords and notes. Implementation of the commands for Voices, Movements, Score etc are not yet done.</div>
<h3 class="subsection" id='magicparlabel-2623'><span class="subsection_label">32.2</span> Directive Edit Scripts</h3>
<h5 class="paragraph" id='magicparlabel-2624'><span class="paragraph_label"></span> Introduction</h5>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-2625'>Score and movement directives can define a value for their graphic – a button then appears at the top of the score which can be used to edit the directive. Likewise Staff and Voice directives show as a properties icon before the staff to which they apply (staff directives above, voice directives below). Clicking on these lets you edit the directive.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-2626'>The command EditDirective can be used when the cursor is on a Denemo Directive object, or an object with a Denemo Directive attached to it. What happens then is determined by a script named after the "tag", or name of the directive. For example the command RehearsalMark creates a Directive with tag "RehearsalMark" and EditDirective runs a script called RehearsalMark.scm.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-2627'>There is also a low-level editing dialog which is invoked if no editing script exists or directly from scheme using (d-DirectiveTextEdit-* tagname). This allows you to edit and delete a directive directly. The other directive editing commands are EditScoreDirective EditMovementDirective EditStaffDirective EditVoiceDirective EditClefDirective EditKeysigDirective EditTimesigDirective for directives attached to the relevant objects.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-2628'>The low level edit of directives from scheme uses the following command:</div>



<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-2637'>Where &lt;tagname&gt; specifies the directive to be edited and &lt;field&gt; is one of score, scoreheader, movementcontrol, header, paper, layout, clef, timesig, keysig, staff, voice, standalone, chord or note.</div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-2638'>For example,</div>



<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-2647'>gives low-level access to the directive setting the print all headers command in the paper block of the LilyPond output.</div>
<h4 class="subsubsection" id='magicparlabel-2648'><span class="subsubsection_label">32.2.1</span> Initialization Scripts</h4>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-2649'>Each menu can have an initialization script, which can contain procedures that would be too time consuming to define every time they are needed. These scripts are guaranteed to be run before any menu item is activated within the menu. They can be read/written using the right click menu on any scripted menu item.</div>
<h4 class="subsubsection" id='magicparlabel-2650'><span class="subsubsection_label">32.2.2</span> Edit Scripts</h4>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-2651'>Each directive has a tag field, so that it can be recognized by the scripts that manipulate it. In particular for each tag there can be an edit script, for editing a directive of that tag. </div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-2652'>Edit scripts are kept in a directory actions/editscripts parallel with the directory actions/menus where the commands themselves are kept. </div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-2653'>You can read and write edit scripts by using the low level editing dialog on a directive with the tag you are writing for. </div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-2654'><div class='Shadowbox'><div class="plain_layout" id='magicparlabel-2658'>The low level editing dialog is the one that is presented if there is no edit script. Edit scripts can themselves give access to this dialog by including an option cue-Advanced which calls (d-DirectiveTextEdit-field tag) for the appropriate field and tag. For an example see the edit script for Instruments -&gt; Orchestra -&gt; RehearsalMark.</div>
</div></div>

<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-2659'>They have available functions to enable editing of directives which are defined in actions//denemo.scm executed at startup. The functions and variables for script editing are:</div>

<ul class="itemize" id='magicparlabel-2660'><li class="itemize_item">d-GetOption followed by a nul separated list of options, offers the options to the user and returns one, or #f if the user cancels.

<li class="itemize_item">Extra-Offset tag type context. Takes three string options: tag is the name of the directive to be edited, which must be the name of a LilyPond object, type is the type of directive (note, chord, standalone, staff, voice or score), context is the LilyPond context of the object. Only tag is required. Shifts the object in the LilyPond output.</li>
<li class="itemize_item">SetPadding tag type context. As Extra-Offset, it sets the space left around the item in the LilyPond engraving process.</li>
