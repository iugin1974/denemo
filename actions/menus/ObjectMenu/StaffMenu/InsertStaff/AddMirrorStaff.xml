        <_label>Add Staff (Borrowed/Mirrored Music)</_label>
        <_tooltip>Adds a staff whose music is automatically mirrored from another staff of your choice. Use this e.g. to create a staff with two divisi parts, while keeping the second part as a separate staff, or to typeset both Fret Diagrams and Chord Symbols from the same music. Note that initial clef/key/time are copied not mirrored, so if you want a different clef in the mirrored staff set that clef temporarily while mirroring. Staff number to mirror is chosen interactively or passed as a parameter to the command.</_tooltip>
